Aspirin may be given if intravenous tPA is not administered however a CT scan is a priority to rule out ICH. Intravenous heparin should not be used routinely in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Wallenberg’s syndrome, or lateral medullary syndrome, involves the following structures: • Vestibular nuclei, causing vertigo, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. • Descending tract and nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve, producing impaired sensation on the ipsilateral hemiface. • Spinothalamic tract, producing loss of sensation to pain and temperature in the contralateral hemibody. • Sympathetic tract, manifesting with ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome with ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. • Fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves, presenting with hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, and decreased gag reflex. • Cerebellum and cerebellar tracts, causing ipsilateral ataxia and lateropulsion. • Nucleus of the tractus solitarius, causing loss of taste. Patients may present with combinations of these manifestations and not always with a complete syndrome. Other clinical manifestations, such as hiccups, are typically seen in this syndrome, but may not be explained by a lesion to a specific structure in the brainstem. The other manifestations are unlikely to result from the anatomic localization of this infarct. Goetz CG. Textbook of Clinical Neurology. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders Elsevier; 2007.

      "explicacao": "This patient likely has a left vertebral artery dissection causing a lateral medullary syndrome. The most common site of a vertebral dissection is at the level of C1-C2, where the artery is mobile as it is leaving the transverse foramina to enter the cranium. The gold standard diagnostic test for an arterial dissection is a catheter angiogram to evaluate the cervicocerebral arteries, which will demonstrate the narrowing of the vessel, the extension of the dissection with an intimal flap, or double lumen. However, a catheter angiogram is an invasive test with potential risks, including the risk of causing or worsening an existing dissection. CT angiogram and MRA with contrast are helpful for the diagnosis of an arterial dissection, and have replaced a catheter angiogram for the diagnosis of dissection of the cervical arteries. MRA with a time-of-flight sequence may also be helpful to assess the flow at the site of the dissection; however, it does not provide information about the vessel wall. When evaluating a possible vertebral artery dissection, limiting the evaluation to the circle of Willis may miss a potential dissection in the cervical portions of the vessel. An MRI with fat-suppression technique is helpful to assess the vessel wall and surrounding tissues, and very useful in nonocclusive dissections, when conventional angiogram will not give information about the vessel wall. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and is useful in the initial assessment; however, the dissection may not be visualized, and ultrasound may not be able to determine the extent of the dissection, especially in the vertebral arteries, which are not completely visualized with ultrasonography. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is less useful and does not provide direct visualization of the dissection. An echocardiogram with bubble study is not indicated for evaluation of vessel dissection. Patients with arterial dissections may have strokes either from vessel occlusion or from embolism originating in the dissected vessel wall. Treatment ranges from antiplatelet agents to anticoagulation, and in some cases endovascular techniques to open the vessel. No significant difference in efficacy has been found between antiplatelet and anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with dissection of 150 the cervical vessels.

      "explicacao": "Figure 2.3 shows bilateral thalamic infarction, which can be seen with occlusion of the artery of Percheron. The P1 segment of the PCA gives rise to interpeduncular branches that will provide vascularization to the medial thalamus. Most frequently, these branches arise from each PCA separately and will give perfusion to the thalamus on their respective side. In some cases, a single artery called the artery of Percheron will arise from the P1 segment on one side and will supply the medial thalami bilaterally. This is a normal variant. If an occlusion of the artery of Percheron occurs, the result will be an infarct in the medial thalamic structures bilaterally. The anterior choroidal arteries do not supply the medial thalamus. The recurrent artery of Heubner is a branch of the ACA that supplies the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the inferior part of the head of the caudate, and the anterior part of the globus pallidus. The pericallosal artery is one of the subdivisions of the ACA, running along the corpus callosum, and does not supply the thalamus.

The clinical manifestations of these lacunar infarcts may have a sudden onset; however, it is not infrequent to see a stepwise “stuttering” progression of the neurologic deficits over minutes, and sometimes over hours to even days. This patient should undergo evaluation, and MRI with diffusion- weighted sequences should be obtained. Even though diabetes control is important, hypertension plays a major role in the pathogenesis of lacunar strokes, and strict blood pressure control may prevent further events.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Anterior circulation aneurysms have a lower risk of rupture when compared with posterior circulation aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms are most often acquired and sporadic; however, there are associations with various conditions, including AVMs, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, Marfan’s syndrome, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Aneurysms can also be familial, and screening with CTA or MRA is recommended in patients with two or more family members with an intracranial aneurysm or history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral aneurysmal rupture leads to SAH, which is a serious, sometimes fatal event. In a patient with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm, the presence of certain factors may be associated with higher risk of rupture, and this may influence treatment decision. Risk of rupture and SAH depends on various factors. Size is important, and larger aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture. Some studies have suggested that the risk of rupture is significantly higher with diameters of 7 mm or higher, and the risk rises with increasing size. Aneurysmal growth may be associated with increased risk of rupture, and patients presenting with a growing aneurysm on imaging, or new symptoms from aneurysm growth (new cranial nerve palsy or mass effect) should undergo treatment. Aneurysm location is also an important factor, and posterior circulation aneurysms (vertebrobasilar aneurysms, including posterior communicating artery aneurysms) are at higher risk for rupture as compared to anterior circulation aneurysms. Smoking and uncontrolled hypertension are also risk factors for aneurysmal rupture, and these conditions should be treated. Patients with previous aneurysmal rupture are at higher risk for SAH. Treatment decision should be made with the patient based on several factors, including aneurysm size, location, and characteristics (like the presence of daughter sacs), patient’s age, risk factors, and comorbidities. Unruptured aneurysms could be managed conservatively (imaging surveillance and observation in those patients with low risk of aneurysmal rupture), by endovascular treatment (coiling), or by surgical treatment (clipping). In selected aneurysms, endovascular coil embolization is associated with reduced procedural morbidity and mortality as 169 compared to surgical clipping; however, the recurrence risk may be higher. Selection of endovascular management or surgical treatment also depends on the age of the patient and other comorbidities, size of the aneurysm, location and morphology, as well as the experience of the center where the patient is being treated.

The right homonymous hemianopsia is caused by interruption of the geniculocalcarine radiations running within the left hemisphere. A stroke caused by occlusion of the left lenticulostriate branches only will not explain the aphasia and the other neurologic findings except the hemiplegia. An infarct isolated to the individual MCA segments after the first bifurcation will not explain the hemiparesis affecting also the lower extremity, nor the global aphasia.

The right and left ACAs connect via the anterior communicating artery. Beyond this point, the ACA will continue around the genu of the corpus callosum, bifurcating into the pericallosal and callosomarginal arteries. The ACA gives rise to various small branches, including the recurrent artery of Heubner, which is a deep penetrating branch that originates in the proximal ACA. The MCA originates from the ICA. The MCA main trunk before the bifurcation gives off many small penetrating vessels called the lenticulostriate arteries, which supply large regions of the basal ganglia and the internal capsule. The MCA will bifurcate into superior and inferior divisions that will supply the lateral convexity of the hemisphere 175 The PCA originates from the top of the basilar, and runs toward the dorsal surface of the midbrain, along the lateral aspect of the quadrigeminal cistern and around the pulvinar, dividing into smaller branches at the calcarine fissure.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "symptomatic carotid stenosis of 70% to 99% should be revascularized. Patients with symptomatic stenosis of 50% to 69% may also benefit from CEA, with greater impact in men versus women, in those with previous strokes versus TIAs, and with hemispheric versus retinal symptoms. In patients with stenosis of less than 50%, there is no evidence to support that surgical treatment is better than medical therapy. The same applies for carotid occlusions, in which the treatment should be medical management. Regarding asymptomatic carotid disease, CEA has proven benefits over medical treatment in patients with more than 60% stenosis as demonstrated in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS), and in the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST), however, the numbers needed to treat were high, and the benefit may not be significant in the real world, depending also on the experience of the surgeon. In ACAS, the absolute risk reduction was 1.2% per year with a number needed to treat of 85 favoring the surgical group. In the ACST, the absolute risk reduction was 1.1% with a number needed to treat of 93 favoring surgery over medical therapy. Carotid angioplasty and stenting has evolved in the last decade, and may be comparable to CEA for stroke prevention (see question 73 for further discussion). Medical management has also evolved significantly since the time of the carotid endarterectomy trials, and the benefit of surgery over medical therapy may be different with current medical therapy. However, comparison of current optimal medical therapy with revascularization has not been evaluated in a modern randomized controlled trial. Brott TG, Brown RD, Meyer FB, et al.

      "explicacao": "Figure 2.13 shows a deep intracerebral hemorrhage, most likely caused by hypertension. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for approximately 10% of all strokes and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The most common cause of spontaneous ICH is hypertension which is responsible for 75% of cases, followed by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Hypertensive ICH commonly originates in deep subcortical structures such as the putamen, caudate, and thalamus, as well as in the pons, cerebellum, and periventricular deep white matter. This occurs from rupture of deep perforating arteries, which suffer changes caused by chronic hypertension, leading to lipohyalinosis, making these vessels susceptible to sudden closure (causing lacunar infarctions) or rupture (causing hemorrhage). Charcot Bouchard microaneurysms have been classically associated with hypertensive ICH; however, they are not found consistently and are described only in a small number of patients. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy results from the deposition of amyloid protein (congophilic material) in the media and adventitia of cerebral vessels, especially in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. This process is associated with cortical and lobar hemorrhages, which may be recurrent. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is seen more commonly in the elderly, and MRI with gradient echo sequences can detect multiple microhemorrhages in the brain, helping to make the diagnosis. (see question 51 for further discussion on amyloid angiopathy). Anticoagulation can be associated with any type of hemorrhage; however, hypertension is a more common cause, and the most likely etiology in this case given the location. Patients on anticoagulation may have hemorrhages showing a fluid–fluid level. Intracranial aneurysmal rupture presents with SAH rather than intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Venous sinus thrombosis is associated with hemorrhagic infarcts, usually in the distribution of the thrombosed sinus. Aguilar MI, Freeman WD. Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.

The rate of early stroke was high in the stent group and lower than expected in the medical therapy group.

The maximum score is 9 points. History of hyperlipidemia is not part of the stroke risk stratification score in patients with atrial fibrillation. Chronic kidney disease has been associated with increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, this risk factor has not been taken into account in the risk stratification scoring system. According to the guidelines, a patient with CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of 2 or more should be offered anticoagulation. In a patient with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of 0, it is reasonable not to treat with anticoagulation. In a patient with a score of 1, based on individual characteristics, could consider either anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, or no antithrombotics. When starting a patient on oral anticoagulants, the risk of bleeding should be assessed carefully, and the decision to start anticoagulation or not should be made on each individual patient taking into account the risk of stroke and the risk of bleeding. HAS- BLED score has been used for the assessment of risk of hemorrhage. In the HAS-BLED score, 1 point is assigned each for hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function (1 point each), stroke, bleeding history or predisposition to bleeding, labile INRs, elderly (age >65 years), and drug use (1 point for antiplatelets or NSAIDs, and 1 point for excessive alcohol intake). A HAS-BLED score of >2 is considered high and associated with risk of major bleeding. However, a high HAS-BLED score should not be the reason to withhold oral anticoagulation, and treatment decisions regarding anticoagulation should be individualized. Lip GY, Lane DA.

      "explicacao": "In the brain, drainage of venous blood occurs through veins into dural venous sinuses, which eventually drain into the internal jugular veins. The dural venous sinuses are venous channels enclosed between dural layers, and they have no valves. The major venous sinuses are the superior sagittal sinus, the inferior sagittal sinus, the straight sinus, the transverse sinuses, sigmoid sinuses, and the cavernous sinuses ( Fig. 2.23 ). The superior sagittal sinus runs along the superior margin of the falx cerebri in the interhemispheric fissure, toward the confluence of the sinuses where it encounters the straight sinus and the transverse sinuses, which will continue as the sigmoid sinuses, draining into the internal jugular veins. The inferior sagittal sinus runs above the corpus callosum in the interhemispheric fissure, connecting with the vein of Galen to form the straight sinus. The deep venous system drains the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamic regions and is composed of deep veins that drain toward the straight sinus. The internal cerebral vein is formed by the junction of the thalamostriate and septal veins, run posteriorly encountering the contralateral internal cerebral vein and emptying into the great cerebral vein of Galen. The basal vein of Rosenthal is a deep vein that drains the base of the forebrain, travels posteriorly between the midbrain and the temporal lobe on each side, and also empties into the great cerebral vein of Galen, located beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum. The great cerebral vein of Galen joins the inferior sagittal sinus forming the straight sinus, which will then run toward the confluence of the sinuses. 195 Figure 2.23 Venous sinuses. Illustration by David R. Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted with permission, Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography © 2015. All rights reserved. The cavernous sinuses are on both sides of the sella turcica and receive blood from facial and orbital structures, including the ophthalmic veins. The cavernous sinuses drain into the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The superior petrosal sinus connects the cavernous sinus with the transverse sinus on each side. The inferior petrosal sinus connects the cavernous sinus with the sigmoid sinus or the jugular bulb on each side, but this sinus may be hypoplastic or absent in some cases. The convexity of the brain has multiple superficial veins that drain into the superior sagittal sinus, the transverse sinus, or the middle cerebral vein, which runs along the Sylvian fissure. Between these structures there are anastomotic veins: the superior anastomotic vein of Trolard and the inferior anastomotic vein of Labbe. The vein of Trolard is a large anastomotic vein that connects the Sylvian vein to the superior sagittal sinus. The vein of Labbe is a large vein traveling over the temporal lobe convexity connecting the Sylvian vein to the transverse sinus. 196 Emissary veins connect scalp veins with the dural venous sinuses. It is important to note that the venous anatomy is highly variable, with reciprocal relationships, in which occasionally when one side or venous group is large, the contralateral or counterpart may be smaller and hypoplastic.

Cavernous malformations are clusters of vascular channels, composed of dilated thin-walled vessels, with no smooth muscle or elastic fibers, and with no intervening brain parenchyma separating the vascular structures. On MRI, they have the typical “popcorn- like” appearance, with a dark rim on T2 consistent with hemosiderin; gradient echo images (see Fig. 2.18 ) may show evidence of cavernous malformations when not evident on T2- weighted images. Cavernous malformations are typically incidental and found in asymptomatic patients; however, they may present with seizures and occasionally with hemorrhage, with manifestations depending on the location of the lesion. Hemorrhage from cavernous malformation is of lesser severity and lower pressure as compared to hemorrhage from AVMs. AVMs are congenital vascular lesions consisting of a tangle of dilated vessels (nidus) in which arteries and veins communicate without an intervening normal capillary bed in between. This lesion can be seen on CT, and CT angiogram (CTA) provides better vascular visualization. MRI demonstrates the vascular lesion with flow voids and regions of previous hemorrhage, as well as its relationship with the parenchyma. Catheter angiography is the gold standard diagnostic study to evaluate the vascular structure, pattern of vascular feeders, and drainage. AVMs present most commonly with intracerebral hemorrhage, with other typical presentations including seizures and headache. Dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) are acquired vascular lesions in which there is arteriovenous shunting typically supplied from meningeal or dural arterial branches, with drainage toward a dural venous sinus. These lesions are associated with increased venous pressure and arterialization of the draining veins. DAVF may present with pulsatile tinnitus, headaches, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits from increased venous pressure and abnormal vascular hemodynamics. Intracranial hemorrhage can also occur. Venous angiomas or developmental venous anomalies are thin- walled venous structures with normal intervening brain tissue. These are asymptomatic with a very low risk of hemorrhage. MRI 199 demonstrates a conglomerate of vessels in a “caput medusa” pattern. Capillary telangiectasias are abnormally dilated capillaries that are separated by normal brain tissue. They are typically found incidentally and rarely become symptomatic. Brown RD, Flemming KD, Meyer FB, et al. Natural history, evaluation, and management of intracranial vascular malformations.

      "explicacao": "anatomic factors (direct vs. indirect). Traumatic CCFs are the most common, associated with head or facial trauma, and most frequent in young males. In general, most traumatic CCFs are direct and high flow. Spontaneous CCFs are typically encountered in older female patients, and may be caused by either feeders to from the ICA or external carotid artery to the cavernous sinus, or spontaneous tear within the cavernous ICA segment, occasionally from rupture of a cavernous ICA aneurysm. With direct CCFs the shunt is of high flow, causing an acute presentation with rapid progression of symptoms. Indirect CCFs are low flow, with insidious onset and gradual progression of symptoms. In indirect CCFs, the feeders may be from either the internal or the external carotid artery. Cerebral angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis, demonstrating arteriovenous shunting at the cavernous sinus, with drainage to the superior ophthalmic vein or to other venous structures. The goal of treatment is to occlude the fistula, and hopefully preserve flow in the internal carotid artery. Endovascular embolization is the treatment of choice, and can be performed transarterially through the tear in the ICA (in a direct fistula) or the feeders (in an indirect fistula), or transvenously using a transfemoral venous approach with navigation through the inferior petrosal sinus or the facial and superior ophthalmic veins to reach the cavernous sinus. Coils and liquid embolics are used through either endovascular route to occlude the shunting site. After successful embolization, chemosis and proptosis improve rapidly, and cranial nerve impairment may improve over days to weeks. Improvement of visual deficits depends on the duration and severity of pre-existing deficits prior to treatment. A last resort endovascular approach is the sacrifice of the involved internal carotid artery after making sure that the patient can tolerate permanent occlusion of this vessel. Surgical treatment is only indicated if endovascular approach is not possible or not successful, and may involve ligation of the involved carotid artery. Conservative management (external manual compression of the involved carotid artery at the neck several times per day for 4 to 6 weeks) may be useful in certain indirect CCFs, but is generally not 205 effective.

Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), available as a prodrug which is metabolized to its active form. It has poor oral bioavailability, and the medication is coated with tartaric acid to improve absorption. Once absorbed, the peak level is reached in 1 to 2 hours and the half-life is 14 to 17 hours. The drug is 80% cleared renally, with the rest being metabolized in the liver. Therefore patients with low creatinine clearance require dose adjustments. In the RE-LY study, Dabigatran 110 mg twice a day was noninferior to warfarin for prevention of strokes and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with lower rates of major hemorrhage; and Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin with similar rates of major hemorrhage. This medication can however cause dyspepsia and may be associated with the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The FDA approved Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, with a 75 mg twice daily dose for patients with creatinine clearance of 15 to 30 mL/min. Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor which is easily absorbed preferably with food, with peak levels at 2 to 4 hours and half-life of 5 to 9 hours. It is 95% protein bound, allowing once daily dosing. Two-thirds are metabolized in the liver with one-third excreted unchanged in the urine. In ROCKET AF trial, Rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with similar risks of bleeding, but lower risks of intracranial and fatal hemorrhages. Rivaroxaban is administered in a dose of 20 mg once daily with a 209 meal, or 15 mg daily in case of creatinine clearance 15 to 50 mL/min. Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor, with peak levels at 3 to 4 hours, and half-life of 8 to 15 hours. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP450 3A4, and 25% is renally excreted. In ARISTOTLE trial, Apixaban 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Apixaban also was associated with lower risk of major bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage, and lower mortality rates. For Dabigatran, the reversal agent Idarucizumab has been approved. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds free and thrombin-bound Dabigatran neutralizing its activity. At the time this chapter was written there are no available specific reversal agents for Rivaroxaban and Apixaban. Most recent guidelines suggest that prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity or recombinant factor VIIa might be considered in individual cases with ICH secondary to these new agents. Activated charcoal can be considered within 2 hours of the intake of Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban or Apixaban. Hemodialysis has also been considered with Dabigatran. Aguilar MI, Kuo RS, Freeman WD.

      "explicacao": "since the treatment may be completely different, including antibiotic therapy for infections, disease modifying agents or chemotherapy for systemic inflammatory conditions or cancer, and as simple as removing an offending drug in drug induced vasculitis. It is also important to evaluate for mimics, in which there is no inflammation but the vessels may appear abnormal on angiographic studies. Mimics include atherosclerosis or conditions such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), CADASIL, and antiphospholipid syndrome. PACNS is an inflammation of small- and medium-sized parenchymal and leptomeningeal arteries involving the brain and/or spinal cord. It is present similarly in males and females, with presentation at a median age of 50 years. Headache is the most common symptom, usually insidious and/or chronic; however, thunderclap headache is very rare in PACNS, distinguishing it from RCVS in which thunderclap headache is a classic presentation. Ischemic strokes and altered cognition are also common presentations in PACNS. The following three criteria have to be met to make the diagnosis of PACNS: 1. Acquired otherwise unexplained neurologic or psychiatric deficit 2. Classic angiographic or histopathologic features of CNS angiitis 3. No evidence of systemic vasculitis or any disorder that could mimic the angiographic or pathologic features A probable diagnosis is made in those with high probability cerebral angiogram with abnormal MRA and abnormal CSF analysis but without biopsy confirmation. A definite diagnosis requires biopsy confirmation of vessel wall inflammation. Three main histopathologic patterns have been found: Granulomatous angiitis of the CNS, lymphocytic PACNS, and necrotizing CNSV. CSF analysis is required in the work up of PACNS, showing abnormalities in the majority of cases, including elevated WBCs and protein. CSF is also important to exclude other diagnoses including infections and cancer. In RCVS the CSF is usually normal but may be slightly abnormal. 211 In PACNS, MRI of the brain may demonstrate ischemic infarcts, areas of gadolinium enhancement in the parenchyma or meninges, and nonspecific hyperintensities in the deep gray and white matter. Cerebral angiogram is helpful, demonstrating the characteristics “beading” which represents areas of narrowing and dilatation. However, cerebral angiogram is not the gold standard for diagnosis and the “beading” pattern is nonspecific, seen also in atherosclerosis, vasospasm and infectious or radiation vasculopathy. Similar angiographic findings are seen in RCVS; however, these resolve within 3 months. Brain biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PACNS, demonstrating vessel wall inflammation. However, the sensitivity of brain biopsy is low, and this could be secondary to various factors, including sampling error and frequent inability to obtain involved brain. The yield of the biopsy may increase by obtaining tissue from an identified lesion on MRI. Treatment of PACNS includes high-dose steroids with or without cyclophosphamide. Once remission is achieved, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil can be utilized for maintenance. The evidence to guide treatment is limited, and mostly based on retrospective observational data and expert opinion recommendations. John S, Hajj-Ali RA. CNS vasculitis.

However, RCVS may be complicated by cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, in which case neurologic deficits may be persistent and the severity correlates with the area involved and severity of the parenchymal damage. Brain imaging including CT and MRI may be completely normal, or demonstrate small cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke and/or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. RCVS has been found in association with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and it is possible that both overlap or represent different manifestations in the spectrum of the same condition. RCVS has also been associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia. RCVS can occur spontaneously, but precipitant factors are commonly associated with this condition, especially vasoactive drugs including amphetamines, cocaine, cold medicines with decongestants, triptans, ergot alkaloid derivatives, and other adrenergic and serotoninergic drugs. Patients also may report triggers such as strenuous activity, sexual activity, Valsalva, and/or stressful or emotional situations. Noninvasive or cerebral angiography may demonstrate “beading” pattern with areas of narrowing and dilatation representing vasoconstriction, which is typically dynamic and may change over the course of the illness. The diagnosis of RCVS is confirmed with the reversibility of these angiographic findings, which occur at some point within 12 weeks. These findings can be assessed and followed up with noninvasive imaging, including transcranial Doppler. CSF findings may be completely normal, or may demonstrate findings consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage, or slight elevations in protein and white blood cells, which resolve spontaneously. Brain biopsy is not indicated, and only obtained when suspecting central nervous system vasculitis. In RCVS the biopsy should not demonstrate vessel wall inflammation. The management of these patients is symptomatic, with supportive care as necessary. Vasodilators such as calcium-channel blockers and magnesium sulfate are typically used. Inciting factors and drugs should be avoided. Steroids are not indicated, and 213 actually have been reported to worsen the clinical course. Prognosis is good with complete resolution of symptoms; however, residual deficits may persist in cases of ischemic stroke or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Ducros A.

Vasogenic edema is usually seen surrounding neoplastic lesions. In cytotoxic edema there is intracellular accumulation of fluid. This type of edema is most commonly seen in hypoxic-ischemic insult, in which there is a lack of energy to the cells, leading to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and subsequent failure of the Na+ K+ ATPase, causing an alteration in the selective permeability of cellular membranes.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "discuss. When sodium nitroprusside enters the circulation, nitric oxide and cyanide are produced. Nitrous oxide then acts through the guanylate cyclase pathway, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and producing vasodilation. The vasodilation occurs in both cerebral and systemic vessels, causing an increase in cerebral blood flow and volume, and increasing the ICP, which along with a decrease in the mean arterial pressures can compromise cerebral perfusion pressure. Therefore, sodium nitroprusside should be used cautiously in patients with increased ICP. With continuous and prolonged infusion of sodium nitroprusside, cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity can occur. Cyanide originates from the nitroprusside molecule and can be cleared by binding to methemoglobin, or when thiosulfate donates a sulfur group, transforming the cyanide into thiocyanate. Cyanide toxicity should be suspected when tachyphylaxis occurs. The accumulation of cyanide can be treated with sodium thiosulfate, which provides sulfur groups favoring the conversion to thiocyanate, which can be cleared by the kidneys. However, thiocyanate is also toxic. Risk of thiocyanate intoxication is increased in patients with renal disease; therefore, sodium nitroprusside should not be used in this patient population. Manifestations of thiocyanate toxicity include anxiety, confusion, pupillary constriction, tinnitus, hallucinations, and seizures. This intoxication can be treated with dialysis. Marino PL.

      "explicacao": "condition. The diagnosis of SAH can be suspected based on a clinical presentation of sudden onset severe headache (thunderclap headache, the “worst headache of my life”), sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness. Altered mental status, coma, and focal neurologic findings may also occur. Whenever SAH is suspected, a brain CT should be performed, demonstrating the hemorrhage in more than 95% of the cases when the scan is performed within 48 hours. If the CT scan is negative, a lumbar puncture should be performed in order to detect blood in the subarachnoid space, evidenced by elevated RBC count and xanthochromia. A negative CT scan does not rule out SAH. Clinical and radiologic grading systems have been developed for SAH and include the Hunt and Hess Grading Scale, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Grading Scale, and the Fisher Scale. Hunt and Hess scale is a clinical grading scale widely used in practice, and characterized as follows: 1. Asymptomatic or minimal headache and slight nuchal rigidity; 2. Moderate–severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than cranial nerve palsy; 3. Drowsiness, confusion, or mild focal neurologic deficit; 4. Stupor, moderate–severe hemiparesis, possible early decerebrate rigidity and vegetative disturbances; 5. Deep coma, decerebrate rigidity, moribund appearance. The World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Scale is a clinical scale based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the presence of neurologic deficits, and characterized as follows: 1. GCS of 15 with no motor deficit; 2. GCS 13–14 with no motor deficit; 3. GCS 13– 14 with motor deficit; 4. GCS 7–12 with or without motor deficit; 5. GCS 3–6 with or without motor deficit. The Fisher grading scale is also widely used, based on admission CT scan, and characterized according to the presence of blood: 1. No SAH on CT; 2. Diffuse or thin vertical layer of blood <1 mm thick; 3. Localized clot and/or vertical layer of blood ≥1 mm thick; 4. Intracerebral or intraventricular clots with diffuse or no SAH.

Blood pressure should be controlled, and hypertension should be avoided in the first few hours, and until the aneurysm has been secured (either by clipping or coiling). Intravenous isotonic fluids are aggressively administered, and hypotonic fluids should be avoided. Hyponatremia is a potential complication seen in SAH, either by cerebral salt wasting or SIADH. Prophylactic antiepileptic agents are given, since a generalized seizure may be catastrophic, especially in a patient with an unsecured aneurysm. Mild sedation should be generally provided, and pain control should be optimal. Nimodipine (not Nifedipine) is a calcium channel blocker that is utilized in a dose of 60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days following aneurysmal SAH and has been shown to improve outcomes from vasospasm. Pravastatin therapy has also been shown to improve outcomes and reduce delayed ischemic deficits from vasospasm. Specific aneurysmal treatment includes isolation of the aneurysm from the circulation, either by surgical clips or endovascular coils. Once the aneurysm is secured, blood pressure can be liberalized, and hypertensive therapy can be used in case of vasospasm. “Triple H therapy” has been recommended for the treatment of vasospasm, and it consists of hypervolemia, hypertension, and hemodilution. This is achieved by expanding the intravascular volume using isotonic fluids, and sometimes colloids such as albumin. Vasopressors can also be utilized. The risk of triple H therapy includes rebleeding from an unsecured aneurysm, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and cerebral edema. A systematic review of the various components of triple H therapy has suggested that inducing hypertension is more effective in increasing cerebral blood flow than hemodilution or hypervolemia. If vasospasm is refractory, endovascular therapies may play a role, including intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators such as nicardipine, or balloon angioplasty of the affected vessels. The use of external ventricular drain catheters is reserved for acute hydrocephalus, or intraventricular extension of blood (Fisher grade 4). Dankbaar JW, Slooter AJC, Rinkel GJE, et al.

      "explicacao": "including those depleted by warfarin, and is a relatively fast way to reverse coagulopathy from warfarin as compared to vitamin K. However, the use of FFP may result in delays from the process of compatibility testing and administration, and it may lead to fluid overload, allergic reactions, and transfusion-related complications. Furthermore, the reversal of anticoagulation from warfarin with FFP may be only transient. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are plasma derived factor concentrates which can provide high concentration of coagulation factors in small volumes, allowing for rapid administration and rapid normalization of the INR. PCCs correct warfarin-related coagulopathy faster than FFP. There are several formulations of PCCs with various concentrations of the required factors II, VII, IX, and X. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a procoagulant agent approved for bleeding complications in patients with hemophilia. It has been used in warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage, and the evidence suggest that it reduces hematoma expansion with rapid correction of the INR, however, its use has not been shown to improve mortality or functional outcome and this medication is associated with increased incidence of thromboembolic events, limiting its use. Protamine sulfate does not correct warfarin-related coagulopathy. Protamine sulfate is utilized to reverse anticoagulation due to heparin, and it plays no role in the treatment of warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage. In patients with ICH in the setting of warfarin, current guidelines recommend withholding warfarin, replacement of vitamin K dependent factors to correct the INR, and administration of intravenous vitamin K. FFP has been typically used. PCCs might be considered over FFP (if available) since they may provide more rapid correction of INR with fewer complications. Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for these patients. Newer oral anticoagulants including factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors are currently widely used for various indications. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor for which the reversal agent idarucizumab has been recently approved. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds free 270 and thrombin-bound dabigatran neutralizing its activity. At the time this chapter was written there are no available specific reversal agents for the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban. Most recent guidelines suggest that PCCs, factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity or recombinant factor VIIa might be considered in individual cases with ICH secondary to these new agents. Activated charcoal can be considered within 2 hours of the intake of dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban. Hemodialysis has also been considered with dabigatran. Ansell J, Hirsh J, Hylek E, et al.

      "explicacao": "The goal of treatment is to stabilize the patient, abolish the seizures, and treat the underlying cause. Initial therapy should always begin with “ABC” (airway, breathing, circulation). Benzodiazepines are the first line of therapy to stop ongoing seizures, and lorazepam is the most commonly used, based on its rapid onset of action, and preferred to diazepam based on its relative longer half-life. It is given intravenously at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (2 to 4 mg). Following benzodiazepines, the second line of treatment is fosphenytoin (or phenytoin if fosphenytoin is not available), for which maximal effects peak at around 15 to 20 minutes. Fosphenytoin is preferred over phenytoin since it can be infused faster, with fewer infusion-related side effects and cardiovascular reactions. The usual loading dose is 20 mg/kg intravenously. If the patient continues seizing, a second dose of fosphenytoin (or phenytoin) can be given (5 to 10 mg/kg). Alternative second line medications have been used instead of phenytoin or fosphenytoin, and these include valproic acid (20 to 30 mg/kg intravenously), phenobarbital (20 mg/kg intravenously), levetiracetam (20 to 60 mg/kg intravenously), or lacosamide (200 to 400 mg intravenously). However, there are no class 1, blinded, head-to-head comparisons of these antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of status epilepticus. Data from clinical trials suggest that if one drug fails, successful termination of status epilepticus becomes subsequently difficult. Refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that does not terminate with benzodiazepines and second line antiepileptic drug. These patients should be intubated (if it has not already been done) and treated with propofol or midazolam infusion to control the seizures. If after continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam the patient continues to seize, barbiturate coma is the next step, usually with pentobarbital, with titration of the dose to burst suppression on the EEG.

A diagnosis of brain death should be made only in patients with normal or near-normal core temperature (>36°C). Death by neurologic criteria or brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of function of the brain, including the brainstem. This diagnosis requires the presence of a catastrophic CNS condition leading to irreversible damage, examination findings of absent brainstem reflexes, and the presence of apnea on the apnea test. To perform the apnea test, the patient should be preoxygenated for 10 minutes with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 100%. A baseline arterial blood gas is obtained, and pCO 2 should be between 35 and 45 mm Hg. The patient is then disconnected from the ventilator but should receive oxygenation at a rate of 6 L/minute. The patient is then observed for 10 minutes for any chest or abdominal rise suggesting an inspiratory attempt. After this time, an arterial blood gas is obtained. If the patient had not demonstrated any respiratory movements and the pCO2 has risen to at least 60 mm Hg, then the test is positive, supporting a diagnosis of brain death. To perform the apnea test, the patient should not be hypotensive (systolic blood pressure should be 90 mm Hg or above), and the patient’s core temperature should be 36.5°C or above. The following is required for the diagnosis of brain death: • Absence of intoxication, neuromuscular blockade, pharmacologic sedation, or a medical condition that may obscure the clinical picture. • A normal or near-normal core body temperature (>36°C). • Systolic blood pressure of more than 90 mm Hg, or mean arterial pressure of more than 60 mm Hg. When in doubt, the following tests can be performed to confirm death by neurologic criteria: • Electroencephalography showing electrocerebral silence in a recording of at least 30 minutes. • Transcranial Doppler showing no flow signals, or abnormal 276 signals including oscillating flow or short and low amplitude spikes in systole without diastolic flow. • Nuclear medicine scan showing no isotope uptake in the brain parenchyma or no intracranial flow. • Angiography demonstrating no flow in the circle of Willis.

Malignant hyperthermia presents with an initial rise in the end- tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) during anesthesia, muscle rigidity, increased body temperature, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability. Rhabdomyolysis occurs, leading to myoglobinuric renal failure. In patients developing malignant hyperthermia, the culprit anesthetics should be stopped and alternative anesthetics not associated with malignant hyperthermia should be used instead, ventilatory support and oxygenation should be optimized, intravenous fluids should be increased, and physical measures to reduce the temperature should be attempted. Dantrolene is a specific treatment that blocks release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and should be administered early on. This patient does not have a history of being on antipsychotics or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These are related to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and serotonin syndrome, respectively. NMS is similar to malignant hyperthermia and is characterized by increased body temperature, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. It is induced by antipsychotics, but other drugs that inhibit dopaminergic transmission may also be implicated. Management includes discontinuation of the antipsychotic and use of dantrolene and bromocriptine. The latter plays no role in the management of malignant hyperthermia. Serotonin syndrome starts abruptly and is characterized by mental status changes, hyperthermia, autonomic hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, clonus, and muscle rigidity. The treatment is supportive, along with benzodiazepines and discontinuation of the causative drug. Marino PL. The ICU Book. 4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2014.

In addition, her headaches are severe, debilitating, occurring up to 12 days per month, and interfering with her job, so she should also be prescribed a preventative agent. Preventive therapy, if not previously started, should be initiated in migraine if the attacks are debilitating, severe (including presence of uncommon migraine findings, such as hemiplegic migraine, migraine with brainstem aura, and migrainous infarction), interfering with daily activities/jobs, and if there are greater than four migraines per month in general, although these numbers are patient-specific and variable. Preventive medication should be picked on the basis of comorbidities. In her case, she is overweight, so topiramate would be a reasonable choice because weight loss can be a side effect of this medication. Other examples would be a tricyclic antidepressant in depressed patients, β-blockers or calcium-channel blockers in hypertensive patients. In question 6, the patient now has had a migraine for more than 72 hours, so she is considered to be in status migrainosus and needs more aggressive therapy. The paresthesias represent cutaneous allodynia as a result of central sensitization related to the prolonged headache phase. Intravenous DHE infusion would be reasonable and safe at this point because she has not had a triptan within the last 24 hours. Other intravenous (IV) medications commonly infused with DHE for additional benefit include antiemetics, magnesium, ketorolac, valproate sodium, and steroids. Dihydroergotamine, steroids, promethazine, and ketorolac can all be administered intramuscularly in the absence of infusion capability.

Agonism at 5-HT 1B receptors constricts the pain-producing intracranial, extracerebral blood vessels in the meninges. Agonism at 5-HT 1D receptors presynaptically inhibits trigeminal peptide release and interferes with central TNC nociceptive transduction and processing, whereas those of the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem are thought to inhibit nausea/vomiting. Ultimately, these effects result in reversal of vasodilation, decrease in neurogenic inflammation, reduction of central nociceptive signal transmission to the thalamus and cortex, and cessation of other ascending pathways to the cortex, which are associated with migrainous symptoms such as photophobia and phonophobia. Triptans come in various administration forms, including needle/needleless subcutaneous injectable (sumatriptan), nasal (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan), oral (sumatriptan, sumatriptan/naproxen, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan), and the most recent formulation, transdermal (sumatriptan iontophoretic transdermal patch that uses a mild electrical current to deliver sumatriptan through the skin).

Trigeminal neuralgia does not have associated autonomic features and is discussed in questions 22 to 26. Following a painful paroxysm in trigeminal neuralgia, there is usually a refractory period during which pain cannot be triggered, whereas this refractory period is not seen in SUNCT or SUNA. The diagnosis of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (which include SUNCT and SUNA) requires at least 20 attacks of moderate to severe unilateral head pain in the temporal, orbital, supraorbital, and/or other trigeminal distribution. The duration of the pain ranges from 1 to 600 seconds and may occur as single or series of stabs. The attacks must have a frequency of at least once daily for more than 50% of the time when the disorder is active; however, the attacks generally occur in a very high daily frequency when active. At least one autonomic sign or symptom on the side of the headache is required to make the diagnosis, including conjunctival injection, lacrimation, facial sweating or flushing, rhinorrhea, congestion, sense of ear fullness, partial Horner’s syndrome (ptosis and/or miosis), or eyelid edema. Symptoms should not be attributable to another disorder. The difference between SUNA and SUNCT is that SUNCT requires both conjunctival injection and lacrimation, whereas SUNA requires only one or neither of conjunctival injection and lacrimation. SUNCT and SUNA are rare enough that an MR image without and with contrast should be obtained to rule out secondary causes, especially pituitary tumors or posterior fossa structural abnormalities.

      "explicacao": "Chiari I malformation. When headaches are related to Chiari malformation, it is due to compression of neural tissue and alteration of CSF dynamics. The headaches are usually in the occipital region and precipitated paroxysmally by cough, bending forward, and Valsalva maneuvers. When symptomatic, there are other findings of brainstem compression or cervical cord compression, such as ataxia, visual disturbances, hoarseness, dysphagia, vertigo, nystagmus, hearing loss, and cervical myelopathy. Chiari is defined as tonsillar herniation below the level of foramen magnum, and it may be associated with syringomyelia (50% to 70%) and hydrocephalus. To make the diagnosis of a headache secondary to a Chiari malformation type I, this finding should be demonstrated on imaging, and there must be evidence of a direct relationship based on the following features: The headache must have developed in temporal relation to the CM1, and/or the headache resolves within 3 months after treatment of the CM1. The headache is precipitated by a Valsalva-like maneuver such as coughing, and/or has an occipital or suboccipital location, and/or the headache lasts for <5 minutes. The headache is associated with symptoms and/or findings of neurologic impairment such cranial nerve, brainstem, cerebellar, and/or cervical spinal cord dysfunction. Other causes or diagnoses must be excluded. Chiari malformations are classified into four types. Type I involves only extension of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum. This is the most common and typically found incidentally during an examination for another condition. It is also the only type that can be acquired. Type II involves extension of both cerebellar and brainstem tissues into the foramen magnum. The cerebellar vermis may be incomplete or absent. It is usually accompanied by a myelomeningocele, which is a form of spina bifida resulting from incomplete closure of the spinal canal and overlying vertebrae, causing the spinal cord and meninges to protrude through a sac-like opening in the back, most commonly in the lumbar region, and usually results in partial or complete paralysis of the area below that level. The term Arnold-Chiari malformation is specific to type II malformations. Type III involves herniation of the cerebellum and the brainstem through the 329 foramen magnum and into the spinal cord and is associated with severe neurologic deficits. Part of the fourth ventricle may also protrude through. Rarely, the herniated cerebellar tissue and meninges are present in an occipital encephalocele protruding from the back of the head or the neck. Type IV is rare, involves an incomplete cerebellum (cerebellar hypoplasia), and portions of the skull and spinal cord may be visible. In general, the upper limits of normal for tonsillar descent by age are as follows: 6 mm for ages 0 to 10 years, 5 mm for ages 10 to 30 years, 4 mm for ages 30 to 80 years, and 3 mm for ages older than 80 years. This patient has no neurologic features or symptoms consistent with a symptomatic Chiari, and her imaging is within the acceptable range for tonsillar descent. Her neck and shoulder musculature tenderness may be contributing to her tension-type headache, and physical therapy should be arranged. In addition, contributors such as stress, depression, and caffeine overuse should be assessed and addressed. She might benefit from preventive therapy at this time, and an antidepressant, such as amitriptyline, would be a reasonable consideration.

      "explicacao": "Although all of the mentioned options are included in the differential diagnosis, the history of trauma and especially a positional quality to the headache suggest traumatic CSF leak and subsequent low–CSF pressure headache, which is what this patient has. Some causes of low–CSF pressure headache include LP, neurosurgical procedures, dural tear from spondylosis, and meningeal diverticula. The most common location of spontaneous CSF leaks is at the level of the thoracic spine. An MR image of the brain with gadolinium will often show pachymeningeal enhancement (as seen in Fig. 4.1 ) and downward displacement of the brain and crowding of the posterior fossa due to the sagging and traction of intracranial structures and dura, which may mimic Chiari I malformation (as seen in Fig. 4.2 ). Neuroimaging may also reveal subdural hematomas or hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, pituitary enlargement, flattening of the optic chiasm, increased anteroposterior diameter of the brainstem, and decrease in the size of cisterns and ventricles. Historical diagnostic testing other than contrast-enhanced brain MRI includes low opening pressure on spinal tap, radioisotope (nuclear medicine) cisternography, and CT myelography. Cisternography is an outdated test and now infrequently used. It is significantly less sensitive than other imaging modalities. Heavily T2-weighted spinal MRI myelography with fat suppression (CSF leak protocol) has come into favor more recently since there is no invasive need to puncture the dura in order to inject a dye or tracer, which can potentially cause a CSF leak if not already present, and there is no need for contrast administration. Conservative treatment measures include bed rest, hydration, and caffeine. If these measures fail, an epidural blood patch should be performed, although it may take two or more attempts for complete relief. Surgical repair of the dural defect is done as a last resort. Headache attributed to low CSF pressure is clinically an orthostatic or positional headache associated with low CSF pressure (which could be spontaneous or secondary) or CSF leakage. This headache can present in conjunction with other symptoms such as neck pain, hearing changes, tinnitus, nausea, and/or photophobia. Treatment of the CSF leak and/or normalization of the pressure in 331 the CSF is associated with resolution of the headache. The orthostatic positional quality tends to be much more pronounced and immediate in postdural puncture headache as opposed to headache attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension, which also may improve upon lying supine, but may not necessarily resolve completely, although these observations are not absolute. The diagnosis of headache attributed to low CSF pressure requires the presence of low CSF pressure (<60 mm CSF) and/or imaging evidence of CSF leak. The headache should not be attributed to another cause or disorder, and it must have developed in temporal relationship to the CSF leak event or low CSF pressure or led to the discovery of low CSF pressure or leakage.

The photograph does not show optic neuritis (see Chapter 1 ), anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (see Chapter 1 ), or posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (see Chapter 1 ). Of the possible etiologies listed, aqueductal stenosis is not a cause of IIH, although it would be a cause of hydrocephalus. Topiramate is used because of its carbonic anhydrase inhibitor effect; it decreases CSF production. Acetazolamide is the classic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used, unless the patient has a sulfa allergy, which would make topiramate a better choice. Treatment typically begins conservatively with measures such as weight loss, cessation of vitamin A (if toxicity is suspected), weaning steroids, and minimizing other potential risks. If there is no evidence of visual loss, some feel that treatment of the headache alone is sufficient. If there is evidence of visual loss, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide or topiramate should be started. Hydrochlorothiazide is not a typical treatment of IIH. Procedures should generally be considered when there is progressive visual field defect, visual acuity loss from papilledema, and intractable headache while on maximal pharmacotherapy. Optic nerve fenestration can be done if visual loss is progressive on pharmacotherapy. Serial high-volume LP is no longer recommended because of the short-lasting effect and unnecessary patient discomfort and inconvenience.

      "explicacao": "be noted that in March 2014, topiramate became the first and the only (at the time this book was being written) FDA-approved preventive migraine medication in adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. The primary mechanism of action of onabotulinumtoxinA is by cleavage of the SNAP25 protein, which is a SNARE (Soluble N- ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor). The heavy chain portion of the onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin binds to the cell membrane of the motor nerve. After binding, it passes through the cell membrane of the motor nerve and into its cytoplasm via endocytosis, where the enzymatic light chain of the onabotulinumtoxinA is activated. Inside the motor nerve, the light chain of the onabotulinumtoxinA cleaves apart the SNAP25 protein, which normally enables vesicles storing acetylcholine to attach to the cell membrane. Cleaving the SNAP25 prevents these vesicles from fusing with the membrane and prevents the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. Thus, nerve transmissions that normally trigger muscle contractions are blocked. This effect generally lasts for approximately 3 months. New nerve endings sprout and connect to the muscle after the original nerve ending is blocked, renewing the ability of the nerve to cause muscle contractions. Therefore, onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin does not permanently alter the neuromuscular junction. OnabotulinumtoxinA effect in chronic migraine may be related to the blockade of the release of neuropeptides involved in the transmission of pain (including substance P, glutamate, and CGRP), theoretically reducing pain sensitization of peripheral nerves. Topiramate has multiple mechanisms of action, including voltage-dependent sodium channel antagonism, enhancement of GABA activity through a nonbenzodiazepine site on GABA A receptors, and antagonism of AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors. Divalproex sodium primarily increases GABA effects and may inhibit glutamate/NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal excitation. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist, including at sites in the central nervous system. Notably, it is crucial when evaluating chronic migraine to exclude the presence of medication overuse headache (rebound headache), which frequently is found to be fueling the high 344 headache frequency. This is discussed in detail in question 65. Gooriah R, Ahmed F. OnabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine: a critical appraisal. Ther Clin Risk Manag. 2015;11:1003–1013.

In women with an increased risk of stroke, and especially with multiple vascular risk factors, nonestrogen methods of birth control are recommended, such as progesterone-only forms of contraception. An interesting study presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 65th Annual Meeting in San Diego in 2013 looked at almost 28,000 women older than 45 years who were followed up for 15 years. It reported that after high blood pressure, migraine with aura was the second strongest single predictor of heart attack and strokes. It came ahead of diabetes, current smoking, obesity, and family history of early heart disease. Migraine with aura predicted heart disease in women at an adjusted incidence rate of 8% versus an incidence rate of 10% for women with systolic blood pressure spiking at more than 180 mm Hg. This increased risk was not seen in migraine without aura. It is not necessarily thought that migraine with aura causes the stroke, but rather migraine with aura is a marker for young women at a greater risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the reasons for these associations are unclear and likely multifactorial. The combination of traditional vascular risk factors still shows the strongest contribution to cardiovascular disease, so risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes and high cholesterol should be optimized, especially in those with migraine with aura to reduce risk of heart disease or stroke.

      "explicacao": "of women with epilepsy ranges from 4% to 10%. This corresponds to a two- to four-fold increase from the expected prevalence in the general population. The currently available data suggest that this increased risk can be attributed, at least in part, to exposure to AEDs. However, it should be noted that increased risk of congenital malformations (compared to the general population) has been demonstrated even in the offspring of women with epilepsy not taking any AEDs during pregnancy. Although robust long-term data are lacking, some of the newer AEDs, such as lamotrigine, appear to have a lower risk of teratogenesis and are felt to be safer than the other choices listed, all of which belong to the first (older) generation of AEDs. It is important to note that clearance of lamotrigine increases substantially during pregnancy, so the dose may have to be adjusted during this time and breakthrough seizures can occur. Data regarding congenital malformations related to AED exposure have been building over the past several years in relation to commonly prescribed AEDs including carbamazepine, valproate, and newer AEDs such as topiramate and lamotrigine. Interestingly, birth defect rates with carbamazepine monotherapy are lower than previously thought and some large studies report only marginally increased rates compared with different controls. Recent data also do not suggest adverse effects of carbamazepine on cognitive development. The prevalence of congenital malformations in association with lamotrigine appears to be similar to that of carbamazepine, and limited prospective studies on cognitive development do not indicate any adverse effects of lamotrigine. Malformation rates with valproate have consistently been two to three times higher than those with carbamazepine or lamotrigine. In addition, data suggest significant dose-dependent cognitive adverse events with the use of valproate. Of the choices listed, valproic acid has the highest risk. It is important to remember that the greatest risk for cleft lip and palate, neural tube malformations, and congenital heart defects is during the first trimester. The neural tube closes during the critical period of weeks 3 and 4. Preconceptional folate supplementation is recommended to decrease the risk of neural tube defects (see Chapter 14 ). A daily dose of 0.4 mg/d of folate supplementation is recommended for all 395 women of childbearing age, and a folate dose of up to 4 to 5 mg/d is recommended for all women with epilepsy taking AEDs.

The risk of afebrile epilepsy after FS is increased in children with developmental delay, abnormal neurologic examination, complex FS (defined later), and a family history of afebrile seizures. There is a <5% risk that patients with a simple FS will develop epilepsy. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients with epilepsy have a history of FS. Simple FSs are characterized by the following: <15 minutes in duration, generalized seizure, lack of focality, normal neurologic examination, no persistent deficits, and negative family history for seizures. Complex FSs occur in approximately 20% of FSs and are characterized by the following: >15 minutes in duration, focal features, abnormal neurologic examination, seizure recurrence in <24 hours, and postictal signs (Todd’s paralysis), and are more likely to be due to meningitis, encephalitis, or an underlying seizure disorder. Prophylaxis is generally not needed but can be considered for recurrent or prolonged seizures, afebrile seizures, after complex FS, and with an abnormal neurologic examination and developmental delay. Chronic prophylaxis commonly includes phenobarbital and valproic acid, whereas short-term prophylaxis could include diazepam and antipyretics, though definitive data on the use of antipyretics for the prevention of FS are lacking. Furthermore, the potential toxicities associated with available antiepileptic agents outweigh the relatively minor risks associated with simple FS. After reviewing the potential risks and benefits of available effective therapies for short- and long-term prophylaxis, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded (in its clinical practice guideline on long-term management of children with FS) that neither continuous nor intermittent anticonvulsant therapy is recommended for children with one or more simple FS.

The thalamus is implicated in the generation and sustainment of absence epilepsy with the low- threshold (T-type) calcium channels of thalamic neurons playing a central role in thalamocortical interactions. First-line treatment includes ethosuximide (which acts via T-type calcium channel inhibition). Valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate, and zonisamide are also used. Notably, the use of lamotrigine has been associated with aggravation of absence seizures on rare occasions. In a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the efficacy, tolerability, and neuropsychological effects of ethosuximide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine were compared in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy. Ethosuximide and valproic acid were found to be more effective than lamotrigine. Notably, ethosuximide was also associated with fewer adverse attentional effects, and, therefore, it is considered to be the best choice for initial empirical monotherapy in children with absence epilepsy. Valproic acid and lamotrigine are often the drugs of choice when there are concurrent GTC and absence seizures. It is important to note that GABA B receptors promote activation of T-type calcium channels. Therefore, some GABAergic drugs can exacerbate absence seizures. Antiepileptic medications can often be discontinued as the child grows older, if the EEG is normal, and there have been no seizures for 1 to 2 years. Absence epilepsy carries a good prognosis.

These are usually described as large- amplitude and bilateral simultaneous myoclonic jerks. Myoclonic seizures are predominantly seen on awakening, and the patient often complains about being “clumsy” in the morning and frequently dropping things. Falls are not infrequent. There is typically no loss of consciousness, although myoclonic seizures can occasionally be followed by a GTC seizure. Most patients have infrequent GTC seizures, which usually also occur on awakening. Some patients with JME also have typical absence seizures. The EEG reveals generalized 4- to 6-Hz polyspike and wave discharges interictally. Ictally, trains of spikes are seen, which are commonly triggered by photic stimulation (during EEG recordings). The first- line treatment is with valproic acid. Second-line treatments include lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, and zonisamide. Carbamazepine and phenytoin should be avoided because they may lead to worsening of myoclonic seizures, similar to the worsening of childhood absence epilepsy seen with these agents. Good control will generally require lifelong treatment and avoidance of triggers, such as alcohol intake and lack of sleep. Auvin S. Treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

      "explicacao": "extend beyond the centrotemporal regions. Although the spikes on the EEG appear in the centrotemporal area, the temporal lobe is not the generator of these spikes. Rather, they are felt to be generated in the base of the rolandic fissure. Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood) is fairly common and accounts for about 25% of childhood seizures. Onset is usually between 2 and 13 years of age, and the condition typically resolves in the mid- teenage years. Seizures are characterized by focal motor, sensory, or autonomic manifestations involving predominantly the face, mouth, throat, or extremities, although secondary generalization can occur. These are seizures that classically occur nocturnally (70% only in sleep, 15% only awake, and 15% both). The EEG is characterized by the presence of independent bilateral, repetitive, broad, centrotemporal interictal EEG spikes on a normal background. The discharges are thought to arise from the vicinity of the precentral and postcentral gyri in the lower suprasylvian region. The characteristic EEG spike pattern is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Normal development, physical examination, and brain imaging are the rule, though there are exceptions. Seizures respond well to certain antiepileptic medication and carbamazepine is usually considered the first line of therapy in the United States. It is important to note that it is often not necessary to treat with AEDs unless seizures are prolonged or frequent; some advocate waiting for two or more seizures to occur before initiating treatment. If antiepileptic medications are started, they can generally be stopped after adolescence. (Only 10% continue to have seizures 5 years after onset.) Bouma PA, Bovenkerk AC, Westendorp RG, et al.

Other side effects include thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, gingival hyperplasia, acne, coarse facial features (also called “phenytoin facies,” from hypertrophy of subcutaneous facial tissue), hirsutism, purple glove syndrome (with intravenous administration), nystagmus, ataxia, dysarthria, diplopia, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Phenytoin can also cause folate deficiency and increased vitamin D metabolism, resulting in premature osteoporosis. Chronically, its use has been associated with a usually mild peripheral neuropathy and with cerebellar but not cortical atrophy. Acutely, the IV form can cause phlebitis, pain, burning, hypotension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Phenytoin is a liver enzyme inducer, so it can increase metabolism of many other drugs. There are variations of calculating loading and correcting doses of phenytoin. A general simple formula for calculating a supplementing (or loading) IV bolus of phenytoin is as follows: (target total phenytoin level − current total phenytoin level) × (kilogram body weight × volume of distribution). The therapeutic range for phenytoin is 10 to 20 μ g/mL. The range for volume of distribution for phenytoin is 0.5 to 1 L/kg, with an average of 0.8 L/kg often used. If we insert the numbers from the case into the formula, the calculation will be as follows: (15 − 10) × (75 × 0.8) = 300 mg. An accurate reassessment of new levels can be obtained by checking free and total levels approximately 2 hours after the IV load. Ahn JE, Cloyd JC, Brundage RC, et al.

It is important to remember that the 10,11- carbamazepine epoxide is pharmacologically active and responsible for many of the side effects seen with carbamazepine use. Because of these differences, oxcarbazepine has less side effects, overall, as compared to carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine has less liver enzyme induction, no autoinduction (and can thus be titrated more rapidly), and is used for the same seizure types as carbamazepine, having the same mechanism of action, metabolic pathways, and side effect profile. Approximately 30% of patients who have a history of a rash with carbamazepine will also develop a rash when exposed to oxcarbazepine. Valproic acid inhibits the metabolism of the pharmacologically active 10,11-carbamazepine epoxide (the principal metabolite of carbamazepine). Thus, although the carbamazepine level may be normal, the patient may experience toxicity because of elevated 10,11-carbamazepine epoxide levels. The 10,11-carbamazepine epoxide is not routinely measured but can be ordered specifically if there are concerns about toxicity. Koch MW, Polman SK.

      "explicacao": "not necessarily the electrographic) seizure. Thus, auras may provide a clue with regard to the seizure origin. Some seizures do not start with an aura, but other semiological signs may point toward the origin of these seizures. Eyes and head version, characterized strictly by a forced and involuntary movement leading to an unnatural position of the head toward one side, are associated with a seizure focus in the contralateral hemisphere and more specifically in the frontal region in the frontal eye fields and motor areas anterior to the precentral gyrus. The association of version with the contralateral hemisphere is more robust if the version occurs immediately prior to the secondarily GTC phase. Therefore, the patient in question 56 has a seizure focus in the right frontal region. Question 57 depicts a case of asymmetric tonic posturing during a seizure, which is characteristic of seizures arising from the SMA. This specific case describes the “figure of 4 sign,” in which the extended arm is contralateral to the seizure focus. Therefore, this patient’s seizures originate in the left SMA (see also question 44). Unilateral dystonic hand/arm posture during a seizure has important lateralizing value in temporal lobe epilepsies, suggesting that the seizure arises from the temporal lobe contralateral to the dystonic upper extremity. The suggested hypothesis is that the discharges originate in the hippocampus and the amygdala, spreading via the fornix and through the basal ganglia, more specifically the ventral striatum, pallidum, and anterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with dystonic posture of one upper limb and automatisms in the opposite upper limb have seizures originating in the temporal lobe ipsilateral to the automatisms. In question 58, the seizure focus is in the right temporal lobe. Gelastic seizures are characterized by uncontrollable episodes of laughter that occur in clusters, as depicted in question 59. These seizures are rare, and commonly originate in the hypothalamus, more specifically associated with hypothalamic hamartomas, although gelastic seizures arising from various cortical areas mainly in the frontal and temporal lobe have been well described in the literature. Hypothalamic hamartoma is a congenital malformation that may be asymptomatic in some cases but commonly presents with precocious puberty and seizures. Seizures 429 may progress and the patient may manifest other seizure types. Harvey AS, Freeman JL. Epilepsy in hypothalamic hamartoma: clinical and EEG features.

Simple FS or complex FS carries similar risk of recurrence. The risk of developing epilepsy following a single simple FS is not substantially different than the risk in the general population. On the contrary, patients with complex FS may be at risk of developing epilepsy in the future. The risk is even higher when the complex FS was very prolonged in duration (i.e., febrile status epilepticus). Other risk factors to develop epilepsy include the presence of a neurodevelopmental abnormality and/or family history of epilepsy. Importantly, a family history of FS does not predispose the patient to subsequent development of epilepsy. The evaluation of patients with FS should be targeted at assessing the cause of the seizure and ruling out CNS infections or abnormalities. The exact pathophysiology of FS remains unclear. A relationship between prolonged FS and mesial temporal lobe sclerosis has been proposed; however, this association is controversial and has not conclusively been confirmed in prospective and population-based studies. Long-term prophylaxis and AEDs are not indicated for FS but can be considered in some cases, especially if a high risk of recurrence exists. In these cases, phenobarbital or valproic acid can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Short-term prophylaxis may also be needed in some cases and should be focused on temperature control during febrile illness and use of benzodiazepines, such as rectal diazepam gel.

However, specific clinical circumstances may support the need for these additional tests on an individual basis, such as if the patient is febrile and CNS infection is suspected, in which case a lumbar puncture would be diagnostic. The risk of seizure recurrence is influenced by various parameters. According to the 2015 practice parameter guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology, there is strong evidence for seizure recurrence in the presence of a prior brain insult such as trauma or stroke, or an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities. There is moderate evidence for seizure recurrence when there are brain imaging abnormalities, or nocturnal seizures. Not every patient with a first unprovoked seizure needs to be treated. According to the same 2015 guidelines, there is strong evidence that seizure recurrence is greatest in the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). The decision to treat is a complex one and depends on the risk of recurrence on the basis of the factors mentioned, the risk–benefit ratio of treatment, and other patient- specific considerations. Immediate AED therapy as compared with the delay of treatment pending a second seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence in the subsequent 2 years, but it may not improve quality of life. Furthermore, over the longer term (>3 years), immediate AED therapy is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission. The risk of AED adverse effects ranges from 7% to 31%, but they are predominantly mild and reversible. Haut SR, Shinnar S. Considerations in the treatment of a first unprovoked seizure.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Sleep stages are separated into four stages: stage NREM1 (N1), stage NREM 2 (N2), stage NREM 3 (N3), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Stages 3 and 4 sleep, previously considered separate stages, are now combined together and called slow-wave sleep. Normal sleep consists of 4 to 6 cycles/night of non-REM (NREM) sleep, with each cycle followed by a period of REM sleep. The first REM period normally occurs around 90 minutes after sleep onset. The sleep stages are defined electrographically by certain criteria as specified by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine scoring manual. Some characteristics of the different sleep stages are as follows: Stage N1: This stage normally occupies approximately 5% of total sleep time. It is marked polysomnographically by slow rolling eye movements, a reduction in muscle artifact, attenuation of the occipital dominant α-rhythm, and increasing slower frequencies. Diphasic sharp waves maximal at the vertex (vertex sharp waves) and positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS) are other features. Stage N2: Typically accounts for approximately 45% of sleep time. This stage is characterized on polysomnogram by the presence of K complexes, such as the one depicted in Figure 5.12 . A K-complex is a diphasic wave (with an initial upward and then a downward deflection) that is maximal over frontocentral regions. The other main feature of stage N2 is the sleep spindle, also seen in Figure 5.12 (red arrow), following the K complex (yellow arrow). K-complexes typically appear around 5 months of age. A sleep spindle is relatively high frequency (12 to 14 Hz), brief (<2 seconds) activity that is maximal over central regions. Delta activity may be present but occupies less than 20% of this stage of sleep. Developmentally, sleep spindles first appear around 2 months of life but do not reach adult appearance until 2 years. Stage N3, or slow wave sleep, was previously separated into stages 3 and 4. It typically accounts for 20% to 25% of sleep time but decreases with increasing age. In N3, delta activity accounts for more than 20% of visually detectable frequencies. REM sleep accounts for 20% to 25% of sleep time. Alpha activity, reminiscent of that seen during wakefulness, may be seen in occipital leads. Obviously, this stage is characterized by the 446 presence of rapid eye movements, as is seen in Figure 5.14A (yellow arrows). Other features include sawtooth waves in central regions. Normally during REM sleep, most muscles are atonic (aside from the diaphragm and extraocular muscles). REM sleep atonia is seen on polysomnography as minimal activity in surface EMG leads placed on the chin, as seen in Figure 5.14A (green arrows; discussed further in questions 92 and 93). REM sleep accounts for up to 50% of sleep time in neonates, and the percentage of sleep spent in REM sleep then decreases with increasing age. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reduce the length of time spent in REM sleep and increase REM sleep latency. The amount of sleep required is greatest in the neonatal period and decreases across the life span. While in the average adult population, sleep requirements are typically in the range of 7 to 8 hours, this is highly variable and long sleep requirements (>10 hours per night) and short sleep requirements (<6 hours a night) may both occur.

Parasomnias have been classified into REM parasomnias, arousal disorders, sleep–wake transition disorders, and other parasomnias. Arousal disorders include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. The latter three are non-REM parasomnias typically arising from slow-wave sleep or stage N3 (previously known as stage 3 and stage 4 sleep; these two stages have been combined into stage N3). Sleep terrors are more common in children, usually occurring between the ages of 5 and 7 years but can occur in adults. These events are characterized by a sudden arousal with screaming or crying, associated with autonomic and behavioral manifestations of intense fear and some degree of confusion if awakened. Sleep terrors occur in the first third of the night (a period during which stage N3 is most likely to occur). In nightmares, as opposed to sleep terrors, the patients usually remember the dream, they occur in the last third of the night, and there is less autonomic activity. When awakened from nightmares, patients are not typically confused. Nightmares are further discussed in question 91. American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

REM sleep, as described in questions 83 to 85, is normally characterized by atonia in most muscles (discussed in question 92), though muscle tone in the extraocular muscles and diaphragm is maintained. Because accessory respiratory muscles are atonic, REM sleep is a period of increased risk for obstructive respiratory events. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur at sleep onset. A useful mnemonic is that the word “go” is present in the word hypna go gic, as in going to sleep. These hallucinations may be seen in normal individuals but are also associated with narcolepsy. Hypnopompic hallucinations occur on awakening from sleep. These may occur in normal individuals and in narcolepsy and do not generally suggest a primary psychotic disorder. While dreams occur predominantly during REM sleep, evidence indicates that they occur during non-REM sleep as well. During REM sleep, there is a normal (physiologic) variability that occurs in heart rate (as reflected by variations in the R-R interval on the electrocardiogram lead). In fact, reduced heart rate variability is considered a sign of dysautonomia. American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed.

In between episodes, patients sleep normal amounts and behave normally. This disorder is more common in males but can occur in females, in whom episodes of hypersomnolence may occur around the time of menstruation. While idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy (discussed in question 95) are marked by hypersomnolence, these are more chronic rather than the intermittent episodes seen in Kleine-Levin syndrome. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, in the absence of a primary nocturnal sleep disorder, or other medical condition or factor that could account for the hypersomnolence. Patients complain of hypersomnia and sleep for long periods of time, but the sleep is not refreshing. The diagnosis is made only when no other medical or psychiatric condition can explain the hypersomnia. Narcolepsy in its classic form, now called type 1 narcolepsy, is a disorder that is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. Patients with narcolepsy suffer sleep attacks, with episodes of involuntary sleep in inappropriate circumstances. Brief episodes of sleep, or volitional naps, lasting 15 to 30 minutes are usually refreshing. In delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) (discussed in question 97), the major sleep episode is delayed in relation to societal norms, resulting in symptoms that may be confused with sleep- onset insomnia, as well as difficulty awakening.

When these patients are able to sleep at the bedtime they are inclined to, there is no problem with falling asleep or waking up. This condition is more common in adolescents. Treatment may include chronotherapy or melatonin. This patient does not have chronic insomnia disorder, advanced sleep phase syndrome, non–24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder, or shift work sleep disorder. In chronic insomnia disorder (discussed in question 100), patients worry about being unable to sleep and focus on their insomnia, which causes frustration and further inability to fall asleep. In advanced sleep phase syndrome, the major sleep episode is advanced in relation to the desired clock time, resulting in early evening sleepiness and early sleep onset, as well as early awakening time (as discussed in question 98). This condition is more common in older adults. In shift work sleep disorder, patients experience symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occurs as transient phenomena in relation to work schedules (discussed in question 99). In non–24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder (also known as “free-running disorder”), the 24- hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm are not in synchrony. This disorder typically occurs in blind individuals in whom endogenous circadian rhythm entrainment does not occur because of lack of photic input into the circadian pacemaker. Non– 24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder manifests with periods of perceived insomnia and daytime sleepiness, as a progressively delaying sleep–wake pattern emerges, alternating with brief asymptomatic periods. This contrasts with DSPS in which symptoms are relatively stable. Jet lag syndrome is another circadian rhythm disorder caused by the travel across multiple time zones, which there is no history of in this case. The suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus is known as the circadian pacemaker and regulates biological circadian rhythms. In DSPS, circadian markers are altered: melatonin reaches maximal levels and core body temperature reaches a minimum later as compared to controls that follow sleep and wake times more consistent with societal norms.

Insomnia is a disorder of initiating and/or maintaining sleep that results in significant fatigue or effects on function or quality of life. In the form of insomnia often termed psychophysiologic insomnia, patients “try to fall asleep” and are extremely concerned about and focus on their insomnia. There is frustration about being unable to initiate and maintain sleep. This worry about the need for sleep prevents these patients from falling asleep adequately, creating anxiety regarding sleepless. These patients do not meet criteria for a generalized anxiety disorder. The history presented in question 100 is not consistent with a circadian rhythm disorder, which all the other disorders listed are.

Irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder is marked by lack of clearly defined and consistent sleep and wake patterns, such that periods of insomnia occur during periods of desired sleep (typically at night) and hypersomnolence occurs during periods of desired wakefulness (during the day). Sleep occurs in erratic bouts throughout the 24-hour period. It is most often seen in individuals with neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and in developmentally delayed children.

      "explicacao": "The direct pathway ( Fig. 6.9A ) consists of the caudate/putamen, GPi, SNr, and thalamus. In the direct pathway, the cerebral cortex sends excitatory projections to the caudate/putamen, which send inhibitory projections to the GPi and SNr. The GPi and SNr normally send inhibitory projections to the thalamus, and inhibition of the GPi and SNr therefore disinhibits the thalamus, increasing thalamic outflow to the cortex. The indirect pathway consists of the caudate/putamen, GPe, STN, GPi, and thalamus ( Fig. 6.9B ). In the indirect pathway, the cortex sends excitatory projections to the caudate/putamen, which sends inhibitory projections to the GPe. The GPe normally has inhibitory projections to the STN, and inhibition of the GPe by striatal projections disinhibits the STN. The STN then sends excitatory projections to the GPi. Recall that the GPi sends inhibitory projections to the thalamus. Therefore, the indirect pathway ultimately inhibits the thalamus, reducing thalamic outflow to the cortex. 501 Figure 6.9 Schematic of normal basal ganglia circuitry. A: Direct. B: Indirect pathways. Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. (Reprinted with permission of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.) The substantia nigra is a structure located between the crus cerebri and the tegmentum of the midbrain. It is a pigmented structure containing a high density of dopaminergic neurons. The substantia nigra pars compacta projects to the striatum, inhibiting the indirect pathway and exciting the direct pathway. A mnemonic for basal ganglia circuitry is as follows: Direct pathway: C innamon c andy g reat in t aste (CCG i T): Cortex → Caudate/putamen → Globus pallidus interna → Thalamus 502 Indirect pathway: Cinnamon c andy g reat excitement and s uper g reat in t aste (CCG e SG i T): Cortex → Caudate/putamen → Globus pallidus externa → Subthalamic nucleus → Globus pallidus interna → Thalamus In summary, because projections from the GPi to the thalamus are inhibitory: • The direct pathway is excitatory: through inhibition of the GPi, it increases thalamocortical activity. • The indirect pathway is inhibitory: through excitation of the GPi, it decreases thalamocortical activity. • These circuits are further discussed in questions 3 and 4. As mentioned, the circuits depicted here are oversimplifications and do not account for many of the connections that mediate movement that are known to exist. For example, the cortex also projects directly to the subthalamic nucleus, the so-called hyperdirect pathway. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

In general, hyperkinetic movement disorders (those associated with increased and/or extraneous movements) result from reduced activity in the indirect pathway, whereas hypokinetic movement disorders (those marked by a reduction in movement) result from reduced activity in the direct pathway and this will be the premise for the following discussion. (Note however that many movement disorders lead to a combination of hyperkinesia and bradykinesia, with the prototype being Parkinson’s disease [PD] [discussed in questions 6 and 7], suggesting that the indirect–direct pathway model is an oversimplification and does not fully explain many movement disorders.) The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) has a modulatory role, by inhibiting the indirect pathway and exciting the direct pathway. The SNc degenerates in PD. Reduced SNc activity leads to a reduction in thalamocortical output due to reduced excitation of the direct pathway (and reduced inhibition of the indirect pathway) ( Fig. 6.10A ). Therefore, one hallmark of PD is bradykinesia. Reduced direct pathway activity obviously does not explain the tremor that occurs in PD. In disorders in which chorea is the most prominent feature, such as Huntington’s disease (HD), a reduction of activity in the indirect pathway disinhibits the thalamus, leading to increased activity ( Fig. 6.10B ). Bradykinesia is also a feature of HD. In fact, Parkinsonism in HD develops in the late stages where it eventually replaces chorea. Thus, a reduction in indirect pathway activity does not fully explain the abnormalities of movement seen in this disorder, again cautioning against the oversimplification of these models. 504 Figure 6.10 Schematic of basal ganglia circuitry in ( A ) Parkinson’s disease and ( B ) chorea.

Urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia are common in patients with PD, occurring in both sexes and resulting from the more generalized autonomic dysfunction that occurs. In PD, urinary symptoms result in large part from detrusor hyperreflexia. Prostatic enlargement can certainly exacerbate these symptoms. Early neurogenic incontinence in a patient with parkinsonism may suggest the diagnosis of multiple-system atrophy (MSA) instead of PD. As mentioned, patients with idiopathic PD do suffer from autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension, and the presence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with parkinsonism does not necessarily imply that their diagnosis is MSA. Unlike MSA, the orthostatic intolerance in PD is usually milder, though it may be severe, and typically occurs later in the course of the disease. Constipation is a prominent symptom in patients with PD, and may predate the motor symptoms for years. It results from impaired gastrointestinal motility due to involvement of the enteric nervous system with the disease. REM sleep behavioral disorder (discussed in question 60) can occur in patients with various neurodegenerative disorders, particularly synucleinopathies, predating other symptoms by years.

Several loci for familial PD have been identified. These are genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous, and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this text, but examples include the following: • α-synuclein ( PARK1 gene), leading to abnormalities in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Autosomal dominant, young onset. • Parkin ( PARK2 gene), a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Autosomal recessive, juvenile onset. • Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 and PARK8 gene).

They increase the duration of action of levodopa, reducing “off” periods, or periods where the patient is experiencing motor symptoms due to wearing off of the levodopa, and increasing “on” periods. The first dopaminergic agent available for PD was levodopa, which is a dopamine precursor. After levodopa is ingested, it is converted in the brain and peripherally into dopamine by the enzyme dopa-decarboxylase (also called aromatic amino acid decarboxylase). The peripheral conversion accounts for its side effects such as nausea (discussed in question 14). Carbidopa is a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor; it reduces conversion of levodopa into dopamine in the periphery while not inhibiting central conversion. Administration of carbidopa on its own is not of use; it is administered only in combination with levodopa. The dopamine agonists include pramipexole and ropinirole; older dopamine agonists including bromocriptine, pergolide, and cabergoline are no longer commonly used in the treatment of PD. Ropinirole and pramipexole are agonists predominantly at D 2 and D 3 receptors. Rasagiline and selegiline are monoamine oxidase type B (MAOB) inhibitors; MAOB is involved in dopamine metabolism. The relatively selective inhibition of MAOB reduces the risk of the “cheese effect” that could be seen with concomitant intake of high levels of tyramine in certain cheeses, resulting in hypertensive crisis (the older MAO inhibitors that inhibited both MAOA and MAOB had a higher risk of this adverse effect). Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic. Its use in PD is limited to the treatment of tremor, as some of the tremor in PD is thought to result from a relative excess of acetylcholine. Another therapy used in PD includes amantadine, which has antiglutamatergic effects, increases presynaptic dopamine release, and inhibits reuptake of synaptic dopamine. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      "explicacao": "Although patients with premorbid impulse control problems are at higher risk of having worsening with dopamine agonist therapy, the dopamine agonists can cause impulse control disorders even in patients without prior history of such problems. The side effects of dopamine agonists include sedation, lower extremity edema, and impulse control problems, such as hypersexuality, pathologic gambling, and pathologic shopping, in addition to other similar behaviors. The occurrence of such impulse control problems often necessitates discontinuation of dopamine agonists. Anticholinergic agents such as trihexyphenidyl and benztropine can cause significant cognitive dysfunction, particularly in older adults, and are thus relatively contraindicated in this age group (also discussed in question 15). Other side effects of these agents include constipation, dry eyes and mouth, and urinary retention. The main side effect of levodopa is nausea; administration of extra doses of carbidopa (which inhibits peripheral conversion of levodopa into dopamine without affecting its conversion centrally) reduces this side effect. Tolerance develops over time. Dyskinesias, or extraneous choreiform movements, occur with levodopa, with the incidence being related to dosage and duration of therapy (with higher risk occurring with increasing duration of therapy). Addition of a catechol- O -methyltransferase inhibitor increases the time dopamine is available at the postsynaptic membrane, increasing the occurrence of peak-dose dyskinesias. Levodopa is more likely to cause dyskinesias compared to dopamine agonists but levodopa-associated dyskinesias should not limit use of levodopa unless they are severe and/or adversely affecting quality of life. Selegiline, a monoamine oxidase type B (MAOB) inhibitor, is metabolized to methamphetamine, which can lead to insomnia. The other MAOB inhibitor, rasagiline, does not have amphetamine-like metabolites. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M. Principles and Practice of Movement Disorders. 2nd ed.

Poor response to levodopa, early autonomic dysfunction, and prominent ataxia distinguish the different types of MSA from idiopathic PD. Prominent early falls and restricted downward gaze distinguish PSP from MSA; as mentioned in question 17, patients with PSP have hyperextension of the neck (retrocollis), whereas patients with MSA exhibit involuntary neck flexion (antecollis). In primary autonomic failure (discussed in Chapter 10 ), parkinsonian features are absent. Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration is discussed in question 20; the prominent dysautonomia in question 18 and ataxia in question 19 make MSA more likely. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

On brain MRI, hyperintensity in the basal ganglia on T1-weighted images is seen. Other toxins that can lead to parkinsonism include the neurotoxin abbreviated as MPTP (which is now used to create primate animal models of Parkinson’s disease) and carbon monoxide (which leads to relatively selective toxicity to the globus pallidus interna).

      "explicacao": "tremor is present in the majority of patients with ET; ET exhibits an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with high penetrance. Although there is this strong familial component, a specific gene causing ET is yet to be identified (at the time of the publication of this book), though an association with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the LINGO1 gene has been demonstrated. The tremor of ET classically improves with alcohol intake. Similar to most movement disorders, it does not continue in sleep (though there are exceptions, discussed in question 41). Enhanced physiologic tremor is one of the most common causes of postural tremor, but rarely causes enough disability to require treatment. It is faster than ET, 7 to 12 Hz. Both ET and enhanced physiologic tremor increase with anxiety, but in enhanced physiologic tremor, the frequency is variable and can be slowed by mass loading (increasing weight on the arm). The presence of family history also makes ET more likely than enhanced physiologic tremor. There is no mention of abnormal posturing to suggest this patient has dystonia with secondary tremor (dystonic tremor). Task-specific tremor is a tremor only occurring, as the name implies, with specific tasks, such as writing or playing of musical instruments. There is no such history presented in the case. Another type of tremor is rubral tremor, also known as Holmes tremor, which is a relatively low-frequency tremor typically present at rest, with posture, and with action. It results from lesions in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and/or the superior cerebellar peduncle, and is often seen in patients with multiple sclerosis. First line agents for the treatment of ET include the β-blocker propranolol and primidone (an anticonvulsant which is converted into phenylethylmalonamide [PEMA] and phenobarbital). Other treatments that have less evidence to support their use include other β-blockers such as atenolol, the antiepileptic agents topiramate and gabapentin, and benzodiazepines including clonazepam. Often, combinations of these therapies are necessary. In pharmacotherapy-resistant cases in which the tremor is disabling, deep brain stimulation to the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus can be effective. Although ethanol intake does improve the tremor in ET, it is not an appropriate long-term 522 therapy. Levodopa is not an effective therapy for ET. For the patient depicted in question 22, topiramate is likely the best option, as propranolol will exacerbate her asthma, and given her occupation, a sedating medication such as clonazepam would be relatively contraindicated.

Nonpharmacologic treatment options include a variety of behavioral therapies, including habit-reversal therapy in which the patient is trained to reenact the tics while increasing his/her own awareness of the tics and urges in addition to other components. The mainstay of therapy for Tourette’s syndrome and other tic disorders are antidopaminergic agents such as haloperidol, pimozide, and the atypical antipsychotics. Clonidine, an α-2- adrenergic agonist, is useful for the treatment of ADHD and other behavioral aspects of Tourette’s syndrome, and improves tics as well. Levodopa would not be the first line of management in Tourette’s syndrome, as it may exacerbate tics (though some of the dopamine agonists have been shown in some studies to improve tics, possibly through reduction of endogenous dopamine turnover by action on D 2 autoreceptors). As mentioned, this patient’s constellation of tics and their duration allows for the diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome; when only motor or phonic tics are present and/or their duration is not sufficient enough to make the diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome, the tics are further categorized on the basis of their qualities. Tics that are classified as simple motor consist of a simple isolated movement such as eye blinking or eyebrow raising. Complex motor tics on the other hand consist of coordinated sequenced movements that resemble normal movements such as truncal flexion or head shaking. Simple phonic tics include sniffing, throat clearing, grunting, or coughing. Complex phonic tics include verbalizations such as shouting obscenities (coprolalia), or repeating others (echolalia) or oneself (palilalia). Secondary tourettism is the term given to conditions in which phonic and motor tics are present but an underlying neurologic disorder accounts for the presence of tics; for example, secondary tourettism is seen in autistic spectrum disorders, static encephalopathy, neuroacanthocytosis (discussed in question 33), Huntington’s disease (discussed in questions 30 and 31), medications, and other causes.

By the age of 16, his limbs and trunk were so “contorted” that he could no longer walk without assistance, and in the prior year, he had become wheelchair bound. He had two cousins affected with a similar disorder but of less severity; his sister, who was 33 years old, had abnormal posturing of her left foot but was otherwise fine.

Treatment of primary generalized dystonia includes anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus interna. Dopa-responsive dystonia (discussed in question 38) shows a good response to levodopa. There are no parkinsonian features to suggest juvenile Parkinson’s disease. Several genes have been associated with dystonia. DYT11, or myoclonus-dystonia syndrome, results from a mutation in a sarcoglycan protein (though other mutated genes have been identified). It is phenotypically heterogeneous but typically manifests with tremor, myoclonus, and dystonia typically beginning in the teenage years and associated with various psychiatric symptoms. DYT3 dystonia, or Lubag disease, is X-linked and is seen in males of Filipino descent and manifests with dystonia and parkinsonism.

      "explicacao": "discussion of epileptic myoclonus). Myoclonus is a brief, sudden, jerky movement that may be either generalized (involving the whole body at once in a single jerk), multifocal (involving different body parts, not necessarily all at once), segmental or focal (involving only one region of the body). Cortical myoclonus is the term given to myoclonus resulting from abnormal activity in the sensorimotor cortex. A cortical discharge preceding this type of myoclonus can be detected by electrophysiologic techniques that involve back-averaging. Lance–Adams syndrome, depicted in this case, manifests after hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, and may not be evident for months or even years after the insult. The most prominent feature is action myoclonus, and when the myoclonus involves the legs, gait is prominently affected. Spinal cord ischemia is not thought to be directly involved in the pathophysiology of this type of myoclonus. Treatment includes benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, piracetam, levetiracetam, as well as sodium valproate. Myoclonus may also have subcortical and brainstem origin, as well as spinal cord origin, the latter resulting in either segmental myoclonus (restricted to a specific limb or area of the trunk) or propriospinal myoclonus (involving axial muscles). Nerve root or peripheral nerve lesions can rarely result in segmental myoclonus as well. Multifocal myoclonus is often seen in the context of a variety of metabolic disorders such as uremia and liver failure; in the latter, negative myoclonus or asterixis is seen. Not all myoclonus is pathologic; physiologic myoclonus includes hypnic jerks, which are hypnagogic lower extremity jerks (occurring in the early stages of sleep) and hiccups.

The symptomatic form is one of the few movement disorders that persist during sleep.

There are several causes of acquired cerebellar ataxia. Hypothyroidism can lead to gait ataxia, and checking serum thyroid–stimulating hormone is indicated in an adult presenting with ataxia. Supplementation with thyroid hormone can lead to improvement of the gait disorder. Chemotherapeutic agents including 5-fluorouracil and cytarabine can lead to significant cerebellar toxicity. In cytarabine toxicity, Purkinje cell loss and gliosis occur, and there is loss of dentate neurons as well; the cerebellar dysfunction is typically irreversible. Metals such as mercury can lead to cerebellar toxicity as well as visual cortex toxicity, leading to a syndrome of ataxia, visual field deficits, and paresthesias. Bismuth salicylate can also lead to cerebellar toxicity if ingested in high amounts. Other cerebellar toxins include the solvent toluene. Chronic intake of phenytoin can lead to cerebellar atrophy due to damage to Purkinje cells. Acute phenytoin toxicity can lead to reversible cerebellar ataxia.

      "explicacao": "autosomal dominant. Repeat expansions are common to many of them, with the CAG repeat most often expanded, but other repeats of different lengths have been identified on different chromosomes, as have been point mutations and other genetic abnormalities. The pathophysiology of the SCAs resulting from repeat expansion is thought to relate to a toxic gain of function, leading to a protein product that is misfolded and abnormally aggregates. The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) typically present in the third to fifth decades of life, but can present at any age, with each of the SCAs having a different mean age of onset. Although clinically heterogeneous, they share in common the occurrence of a progressive truncal and limb ataxia, often with associated spasticity and other upper motor neuron findings. Other abnormalities depending on the subtype include impaired saccades and smooth pursuits, cranial nerve abnormalities, and in some cases neuropathy. In some of the SCAs, epilepsy and cognitive decline occur. In SCA7, there is retinopathy with vision loss. MRI of the brain shows cerebellar atrophy and in some cases, atrophy of the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. The most common spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is SCA3, also known as Machado–Joseph disease. Like SCA1 and SCA2, age of onset is typically in the third to fourth decades of life, though wide variability again occurs. In addition to ataxia and other cerebellar signs, facial and tongue atrophy and fasciculations occur, and bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia are common. Levodopa- responsive parkinsonism may occur. Neuropathy is a late feature. SCA3 results from expansion of the CAG repeat in the gene ataxin 3 on chromosome 14. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Although small basal ganglia calcifications are an incidental imaging finding of little clinical significance in most patients, the extent of calcification seen on this patient’s CT scan combined with the history and examination findings suggest that this is clinically relevant and likely contributing to his parkinsonism. The distribution of calcium deposition includes most often the caudate, but also putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum, among other areas. Striopallidodentate calcinosis can be idiopathic, but can also be seen in both autosomal dominant and recessive familial forms, and a variety of metabolic disorders including secondary hyperparathyroidism as is seen in end-stage renal disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, as well as hypoparathyroidism. Interestingly, one of the genes mutated in familial forms of this disorder, SCL20A2, is involved in phosphorous transport and has been directly implicated in the abnormal calcium phosphate deposition that occurs in brain parenchyma. Another causative gene mutation has been identified in a gene encoding platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGFB), and the proposed mechanism for calcium deposition in such cases has been related to blood–brain barrier disruption.

Genetic mutations causative of an NBIA and associated imaging findings are as follows (note the imaging features presented are classic but may be absent or subtle): • Pantothenate-kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN): this is the most common NBIA. Due to mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 gene. Imaging findings include hypointensity of the globus pallidus with a central hyperintensity (so-called eye-of-the-tiger sign, which is suggestive but not pathognomonic), as well as, in some cases, hypointensity of the substantia nigra and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. Iron deposition may be absent or subtle particularly in adult-onset cases. • PLA2G6–associated neurodegeneration (PLAN): due to mutations in a phospholipase gene, PLA2G6, which is also the causative gene for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Cerebellar atrophy on MRI is prominent in this disorder. • Mitochondrial membrane protein–associated neurodegeneration (MPAN): due to mutations in chromosome 9 open reading frame 12 (C19orf12). On MRI, in addition to iron deposition evident on GRE in the globus pallidus, iron deposition in the substantia nigra may be prominent, and there may be a hyperintense streak-like appearance within the globus pallidus on conventional T2. • Beta-propeller protein–associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) due to mutations in WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) gene. A T1 halo of hyperintensity surrounding the substantia nigra on T1- weighted imaging suggests this disorder. Psychomotor regression followed by static encephalopathy in childhood, with subsequent relatively abrupt onset of dystonia or other abnormal movements later (in early adulthood) may be seen with BPAN. • Neuroferritinopathy: due to mutations in ferritin light chain. Serum ferritin may be low in some but not all cases. Iron deposition is widespread involving not only the globus pallidus but also cortex, caudate, and putamen. Among the NBIAs, neuroferritinopathy (along with aceruloplasminemia) is more 553 likely than some of the others to present in adulthood. • Aceruloplasminemia: an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene. Caudate, putamen, red nucleus, and thalamic involvement with iron deposition is seen on MRI. Along with neuroferritinopathy, it has a higher average age of onset compared to the other NBIAs. • Fatty-acid hydroxylase–associated neurodegeneration (FAHN): due to mutations in the fatty-acid hydroxylase gene. In addition to iron deposition, white matter changes maybe prominent on MRI in this disorder. • Kufor-Rakeb syndrome: due to mutations in ATP13A2. In addition to the many manifestations of NBIAs described above, oculogyric dystonic spasms and facial-faucial finger mini- myoclonus may be seen, and these findings would suggest this as a potential etiology in the evaluation of a patient with a presumed NBIA. • CoA synthase protein–associated neurodegeneration (CoPAN). While kernicterus, due to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, can lead to bilateral basal ganglia lesions and abnormalities of movement in childhood, the perinatal history presented is not consistent with this and kernicterus would not be associated with the abnormalities on GRE seen in this case, but rather with hyperintensity in the globus pallidus on T2-weighted imaging. Basal ganglia calcifications can lead to abnormalities of movement (as discussed in question 57) and the findings seen in Figure 6.7 , however, calcifications would have been evident on CT scan. Hemosiderin resulting from hemorrhage is on the differential diagnosis of the image seen in Figure 6.7 on GRE, but the clinical history (of a progressive disorder rather than an acute presentation) and symmetric GRE findings make bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages highly unlikely. Finally, in utero basal ganglia infarcts would not be associated with the GRE image findings seen in Figure 6.7 (but rather with encephalomalacia in the affected areas), and the clinical history is not consistent.

      "explicacao": "criteria. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis usually occurs in older patients. These patients have a gradually progressive course from onset and do not have relapses. They may have a lower burden of MRI lesions than do patients with RRMS. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute disorder, more common in childhood, and often occurs soon after an infection or vaccination. Patients with ADEM develop a severe disorder with multifocal demyelination in the brain and spinal cord (see discussion to questions 19 to 21). Fulminant multiple sclerosis indicates a rapidly progressive course with repeated relapses that are refractory to standard treatment. There are no laboratory tests that are presently useful in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. On occasion, other disorders can mimic multiple sclerosis. Diseases commonly tested for in early evaluation of multiple sclerosis include vitamin B 12 deficiency, lupus, Lyme disease in endemic areas, and other inflammatory disorders depending on clinical suspicion. Skin biopsy for small- fiber neuropathy may be useful for patients with paresthesias that affect the limbs and face, that are persistent, and in whom there is no evidence to suggest central demyelination. Somatosensory- evoked, or visual-evoked, potentials may be useful in selected patients to ascertain a second lesion or show slowing, suggestive of central demyelination. Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials can be abnormal in the population with multiple sclerosis, but generally are not helpful diagnostically (insensitive in early multiple sclerosis for subclinical brainstem lesions). CSF may show mild elevation in WBCs, predominantly lymphocytes. Measures of immune activity are sometimes, but not always, abnormal, including immunoglobulin G synthesis rate and the presence of oligoclonal bands (indicating antibody formation in the spinal fluid compartment). The prognosis for RRMS is better than most people expect. Various studies have shown a good prognosis over 10 years in a representative population without treatment. However, neurologic examination shows abnormalities after 10 years of disease in most patients. The diagnosis of benign multiple sclerosis is a retrospective one after 15 to 20 years of disease without measurable disability and cannot be reliably predicted. This occurs 577 in approximately 10% to 20% of patients with multiple sclerosis. Pregnancy does not affect the overall course of multiple sclerosis. Most patients with RRMS will not progress to wheelchair status within 10 years. Fox RJ, Bethoux F, Goldman MD, et al.

      "explicacao": "compared to the normal eye. This leads to a relative reduction in signal traveling to the Edinger–Westphal nucleus in the midbrain from the affected eye. Thus, light shone into the affected eye causes a normal consensual light reflex. (Both the pupils constrict.) When the stimulus is shifted to the “good” eye, pupils remain constricted, and then when shifted back to the affected eye, there is relatively less “light,” so the pupils dilate (see also Chapter 1 ). This is not an indication of an effect on the third nerve, which is the efferent arm of the pupillary light reflex. This does not suggest a particular prognosis. This does not imply a meningeal component. MRI of the brain is ordered primarily to assess evidence and risk of progression in multiple sclerosis. On occasion, imaging of the optic nerve can confirm optic nerve involvement, but it is not critical for the diagnosis of optic neuritis. Rarely, retro-orbital or meningeal processes can cause sudden visual loss, simulating optic neuritis. On occasion, sinus cystic disease can cause impingement on or inflammation in the optic nerve. If there are one or more well-defined demyelinating lesions on MRI, the risk of multiple sclerosis goes from about 20% in 5 years to approximately 80% over 5 years. Multiple treatment trials in patients with a single episode of demyelination and MRI brain lesions have shown benefit from starting medicines that are FDA approved for multiple sclerosis treatment in such patients. In general, when the MRI does not show such lesions, treatment is not indicated beyond steroid therapy acutely. Unless the patient has a history suggestive of syphilis, syphilis serology is not useful. Angiotensin-converting enzyme testing is not useful in this situation unless there are other indications to suggest sarcoidosis. Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials are of low yield in this situation. There is no indication for retinal angiography in typical optic neuritis. It may be useful if there are atypical features such as a horizontal scotoma or very sudden painless onset suggesting a vascular etiology. Balcer LJ. Clinical practice. Optic neuritis.

      "explicacao": "Neuromyelitis optica (Devic’s disease) is a neuroinflammatory condition with a distinct pathology and clinical course. Histologically, focal areas of demyelination are seen with significant leukocyte infiltration and some areas of frank necrosis and cavitation. There may be nearly complete axon loss within lesions. There are antibodies, neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG), that bind selectively to the aquaporin-4 water channel. This is a component of the dystroglycan-protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood–brain barrier. Lupus myelitis can be acute as well, but patients have other markers of lupus, such as skin rash, arthritis, and renal involvement. Relapsing optic neuritis and myelitis together would be unusual in lupus myelitis. Fulminant multiple sclerosis could cause this syndrome, but the presence of severe optic neuritis bilaterally should suggest the diagnosis of Devic’s disease first. Laboratory testing for NMO-IgG is positive in 70% of such cases. Subacute combined degeneration could cause paresthesias of the feet, but does not cause a relapsing optic neuritis. Neurosarcoidosis can mimic most neurologic disorders, but is usually a diagnosis of exclusion or diagnosed when systemic markers of this disease are present (e.g., skin, lung, and other organ involvement; see Chapter 16 ). Devic’s disease progresses with relapses, but does not tend to progress in between relapses. It can have a monophasic or relapsing course. It is often severe. It can exhibit a spinal form. Relapses are frequently severe and may not recover completely. Treatment is urgent in relapses of Devic’s disease and many of the deficits do not resolve completely. Interferon β does not seem to be effective in Devic’s disease. There are no data on the use of natalizumab in Devic’s disease. Medicines that have been used anecdotally include steroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and other immunosuppressants. For acute exacerbations, IV steroids or plasmapheresis can be used. Early in Devic’s disease, the brain tends to be spared. However, later in the course, it may have some atypical features, with brainstem disease extending up from the spinal cord, lesions atypical for multiple sclerosis in the brain, and imaging findings consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. 585 Lennon VA, Kryzer TJ, Pittock SJ, et al.

Trials have shown a 60% to 70% reduction in exacerbation rate, reduced activity on MRI, and slowed progression with the use of this medicine in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the United States, it is indicated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis usually when patients have failed other forms of disease-modifying therapy. Use of natalizumab requires an FDA-approved monitoring program. There is an approximately 1 in 1,000 risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients on natalizumab. The risk appears to be higher with prior or additional immunosuppressing medicines and after 2 years of continuous use. Patients with positive serum JC virus antibodies are at even higher risk. There are no comparative studies of natalizumab and mitoxantrone in multiple sclerosis. Mitoxantrone has been associated with treatment-related acute leukemia and dose- dependent cardiomyopathy, and rates appear to be high for both of these side effects. Anaphylaxis occurs in about 1 in 50 patients often by the second to fourth dose of natalizumab. Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, hypotension, rash, and tachycardia. The infusion should be stopped immediately if this occurs, and treatment for anaphylaxis should be instituted. This is an absolute contraindication to restarting natalizumab. There is no desensitization procedure, nor should the medicine be retried with premedication or at a lower dose. This is not related to immunoglobulin A deficiency. PML symptoms include aphasia, visual field deficits, headache, hemiparesis, and cognitive dysfunction progressing over weeks. Patients develop focal subcortical lesions in multiple brain areas that can at times be difficult to discriminate from multiple sclerosis lesions. CSF may be positive for JC virus PCR, which is the causative agent for PML. Treatment for PML in this population includes stopping natalizumab as soon as there is a suspicion of PML, checking JC virus PCR, and beginning plasmapheresis to clear residual natalizumab more rapidly from the system.

Dalfampridine is a symptomatic therapy, and can be used in combination with disease- modifying agents. It is an extended-release form of 4- aminopyridine (previously known as fampridine). Dalfampridine is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of voltage-sensitive potassium channels. In laboratory studies, dalfampridine has been found to improve impulse conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers and to increase synaptic transmitter release at nerve endings. Dalfampridine is administered as a 10-mg timed-release pill every 12 hours. In two phase III trials in patients with multiple sclerosis randomized to dalfampridine versus placebo, a significantly greater percentage of patients were “responders” on dalfampridine than on placebo. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed while on therapy than while not on therapy. About one-third patients responded to dalfampridine in these studies. The increased response rate in the dalfampridine group was observed across all four major types of multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing, and primary progressive).

Prostate cancer has been described to spread to the leptomeninges, and this is thought to occur through dissemination via Batson’s plexus, which is a network of valveless veins that connect pelvic veins with internal vertebral veins. The clinical manifestations of leptomeningeal disease are varied, but frequently, these patients present with headache and backache. Polyradiculopathies, multiple cranial neuropathies, and altered mental status are often seen. Some patients have features of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. The MRI shows leptomeningeal enhancement. The diagnosis can be established with CSF studies using cytologic evaluation and flow cytometry. CSF also will show a pleocytosis with increased protein and sometimes reduced glucose. However, CSF cytologic analysis is not sensitive, and many times repeated testing is needed. In some cases, leptomeningeal biopsy may be required. The treatment is radiation therapy to symptomatic areas, often requiring whole-brain radiation. Some cases are treated with intrathecal chemotherapy and, preferably, intraventricular chemotherapy with methotrexate via an Ommaya reservoir. Unfortunately, the combination of brain radiation and chemotherapy carries a significant risk of leukoencephalopathy. Patients with meningeal carcinomatosis have a poor prognosis, usually with survivals of less than 6 months. In general, best response occurs in lymphomas, breast cancer, and small cell lung cancers. Worse prognosis is seen with other types of lung cancer and melanomas. In this case, the leptomeningeal disease explains the multiple cranial neuropathies, and there is no indication to think about a brain stem infiltrative disease. γ knife targets focal lesions, and is not useful in diffuse meningeal disease.

There are perivascular pseudorosettes, in which the cells surround blood vessels (as in Fig. 8.7 ). There are also true ependymal rosettes, in which the cells are arranged around a clear space. Homer-Wright rosettes are not seen in these types of tumors (but rather in medulloblastoma). Most ependymomas are WHO grade II. Anaplastic ependymomas are graded as WHO III, and are characterized by the presence of increased mitotic activity, hypercellularity, and microvascular proliferation. WHO grade II ependymomas may be surgically curable with a good prognosis, being the extent of resection an important prognostic factor. Radiation therapy may be used for residual disease. Prognosis is worse in patients younger than 3 years of age at presentation. Ependymomas in contact with the CSF may produce drop metastases conferring a worse prognosis. Myxopapillary ependymoma is a WHO grade I variant that occurs almost exclusively in the filum terminale. It is more common in adults, has a red appearance grossly, and a thin collagenous capsule. These tumors have a better prognosis. Genetically, ependymomas may be associated with chromosome 22q deletions, and spinal ependymomas may be related to NF2 mutations (not NF1).

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "adenomas greater than 1 cm in size are classified as macroadenomas, whereas those less than 1 cm in size are classified as microadenomas. Most pituitary adenomas are nonsecretory; of the secretory ones, prolactin-secreting adenomas (so-called prolactinomas) are the most common, though those secreting growth hormone, ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and follicle- stimulating hormone also occur. Luteinizing hormone–secreting adenomas are rare. Patients may be asymptomatic, as in this patient’s case in which the visual field deficit was detected incidentally. In women, symptoms including galactorrhea and amenorrhea lead to earlier diagnosis, particularly in the case of prolactinomas. In men, prolactinomas may present with impotence. Endocrine disturbances may occur with nonsecretory adenomas when the lesion is large enough to compromise normal pituitary tissue function. Other symptoms include headache, ophthalmoparesis, and vision loss. Pressure on or invasion into the cavernous sinus may lead to cranial neuropathies. Pituitary adenomas are the most common masses in the sellar region. The lesion is isointense on T1, and enhances almost homogeneously with contrast, as seen in Figure 8.17 . Figure 8.18 shows evidence of monomorphic eosinophilic cells. Besides tumors of pituitary origin, other tumors that may occur in the sellar region include gliomas, meningiomas, chordomas, metastases, and others. Pituitary apoplexy, or hemorrhage into, most commonly, a pituitary macroadenoma, presents with sudden severe headache, ophthalmoparesis, and in some cases evidence of increased intracranial pressure. The histopathologic findings seen in Figure 8.18 are not consistent with craniopharyngioma or Rathke’s cleft cyst. Craniopharyngiomas are benign epithelioid tumors that originate from remnants of Rathke’s pouch and arise in the sellar region, where they grow to produce manifestations from mass effect on adjacent structures. Craniopharyngiomas are multicystic, with squamous epithelial cells and sometimes calcifications. Rathke’s cleft cysts occur in between the anterior and posterior hypophysis. They have a thin-walled lining containing a cloudy fluid, and they are lined by columnar epithelium with ciliated and goblet cells. 655 Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history, examination, and laboratory testing are consistent with Refsum’s disease (RD). RD is an autosomal dominant peroxisomal disorder that results from a defect in an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism, leading to accumulation of an intermediate in this pathway, phytanic acid. Clinical manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa (with night blindness and visual field constriction), cardiomyopathy, and skin changes. Neurologic manifestations include neuropathy, hearing loss, anosmia, ataxia, and cerebellar signs. The neuropathy is a large- fiber sensorimotor neuropathy. The presence of overriding toes due to a shortened fourth metatarsal may aid in the diagnosis. Treatment includes dietary modification to reduce dietary intake of phytanic acid. Clinical features of the other disorders listed also include retinitis pigmentosa and neuropathy, but elevated phytanic acid levels are diagnostic of Refsum’s disease. In myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE), intestinal pseudoobstruction is a prominent feature; other features include ophthalmoparesis and a demyelinating neuropathy. MNGIE is due to a mutation in the thymidine phosphorylase gene. Abetalipoproteinemia, also known as Bassen–Kornzweig syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in defective triglyceride transport, leading to abnormal very low- density lipoprotein secretion. Fat malabsorption results in deficiencies in vitamins A, E, D, and K. Low levels of serum β- lipoprotein and vitamin E in the serum suggest the diagnosis. Peripheral smear shows acanthocytes. Clinical manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa, neuropathy, and ataxia. Neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa syndrome is a mitochondrial cytopathy that results from a mutation in the adenosine triphosphate 6 gene. Patients may present with a predominantly sensory axonal neuropathy. Other mitochondrial cytopathies including mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like symptoms and disorders due to polymerase γ mutations can also lead to neuropathy. Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial disorder resulting from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. It manifests before the age of 20 with retinitis pigmentosa, progressive 711 ophthalmoplegia, cardiac conduction defects, ataxia, myopathy, and hearing loss; neuropathy is not a prominent feature of KSS.

This method of calculating conduction velocity thereby avoids being confounded by time spent traversing the neuromuscular junction and triggering a muscle action potential (since these are subtracted out). In general, for sensory and motor responses, a decrease in the amplitudes correlates with axon loss lesions. On the other hand, prolonged latencies and slow conduction velocities correlate with demyelination. Low amplitudes can result from demyelinating conduction block when the nerve stimulation is proximal to the block. The F-wave and the H-reflex are late responses. The F-wave is obtained after supramaximal stimulation of a motor nerve while recording from a muscle. The electrical impulse travels antidromically (conduction along the axon opposite to the normal direction of impulses) along the motor axons toward the motor neuron, backfiring and then traveling orthodromically (conduction along the motor axon in the normal direction) down the nerve to be recorded at the muscle. The H-reflex is the electrophysiologic equivalent of the ankle reflex (S1 reflex arc) and is obtained by stimulating the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa while recording at the soleus. The electrical impulse travels orthodromically through a sensory afferent, enters the spinal cord, and synapses with the anterior horn cell, traveling down the motor nerve to be recorded at the muscle.

It is increased in denervated muscles and myotonic disorders, and is decreased when the muscle is replaced by fat or connective tissue and during episodes of periodic paralysis. Spontaneous activity is assessed with the muscle at rest, and examples include fibrillation potentials, fasciculation potentials, and myokymia and myotonic potentials. All spontaneous activity is abnormal. MUPs are obtained while the needle is inserted into the muscle during voluntary contraction. Various characteristics are of consideration, including recruitment pattern and MUP morphologic features, such as duration, amplitude, and configuration. Recruitment is a measure of the number of MUPs firing during increased force of voluntary muscle contraction. In axon loss lesions, reduced recruitment is characterized by a less-than- expected number of MUPs firing more rapidly than expected. Early or rapid recruitment occurs in myopathic processes with loss of muscle fibers, in which an excessive number of short-duration and small-amplitude MUPs fire during the muscle contraction. With poor voluntary effort or with CNS disorders causing weakness, recruitment is reduced with normal MUPs firing at slow or moderate rates, sometimes in a variable fashion. In neuropathic disorders with denervation and reinnervation, MUPs disclose increased duration and amplitude, and may be polyphasic. In myopathic disorders, MUPs are of reduced duration and amplitude, and may also be polyphasic. Katirji B. Electromyography in Clinical Practice: A Case Study Approach. 1st ed.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "radiculopathies are usually diagnosed with the needle EMG component rather than the NCS component of the electrodiagnostic study. The dorsal root ganglion is located just outside the spinal canal within the intervertebral foramen. It has sensory unipolar neurons with preganglionic fibers that extend proximally and enter the spinal cord through the dorsal horns, projecting rostrally in the spinal cord. The postganglionic fibers project distally through the spinal nerves and peripheral nerves, carrying information from a dermatome. On the other hand, the motor fibers originate from the anterior horn cells within the spinal cord, projecting distally through spinal nerves and peripheral nerves, carrying motor innervation to a myotome. A radiculopathy occurs from an intraspinal canal lesion resulting in damage of the preganglionic fibers. The cell body in the dorsal root ganglia and the postganglionic fibers remain unaffected, and therefore, even though sensory symptoms are prominent, the SNAPs are normal. An axon loss radiculopathy will also injure motor fibers in the intraspinal canal region affecting the respective myotome. This leads to denervation, with fibrillation potentials seen 3 weeks after the onset of motor axon loss, decreased recruitment, and 3 to 6 months later, large and polyphasic motor unit potentials (MUPs). The presence of these large and polyphasic MUPs is dependent on reinnervation and collateral innervation, typically occurring in a proximal to distal fashion, with proximal muscles more successfully reinnervated as compared to distal muscles. The H-reflex is the electrophysiologic equivalent of the ankle reflex, which is an S1 reflex, and this test is helpful in the evaluation of S1 radiculopathies. Katirji B.

Physical examination may show provocation of symptoms with repetitive tapping on the median nerve at the wrist (Tinel’s sign) and with hyperflexion of the wrists for a period of time (Phalen’s maneuver). The only motor branch of the median nerve distal to the carpal tunnel is the thenar (or recurrent) motor branch; in advanced carpal tunnel, the thenar muscles are therefore weak and atrophied and show evidence of denervation on EMG. In such cases, there is weakness of thumb abduction and opposition, with weakness in activities requiring fine motor coordination of the first three digits such as buttoning. Figure 9.3 shows prolonged distal median nerve SNAP latency. Motor NCS and EMG are normal indicating mild carpal tunnel. With more advanced demyelination, evidence of conduction block at the wrist may be found, but it requires more distal stimulation near or at the palm for confirmation. With more severe carpal tunnel, with axon loss, prolonged distal motor latencies and reduced amplitudes of the CMAP and SNAP are seen. When severe, there is also evidence of denervation in median nerve–innervated thenar muscles on EMG. Absence of neck pain makes radiculopathy less likely. In addition, the brachioradialis deep tendon reflex is intact. Although a C6 radiculopathy would lead to sensory loss over the lateral thumb, it would also lead to sensory loss over the lateral forearm, in addition to weakness in forearm flexion and supination, which are not evident in this case. A C7 radiculopathy leads to sensory loss over the third digit, but both a C6 and C7 radiculopathy are less likely on the basis of the abnormal median nerve sensory NCS, and absence of weakness or fibrillation potentials in C6- and C7- innervated muscles. In radiculopathy, because the dorsal root ganglion lies distal to the lesion, sensory NCS remain normal, despite sensory complaints the patient may have. A brachial plexopathy would usually not lead to the limited distribution of sensory symptoms without motor symptoms as well.

The dorsal scapular nerve, which innervates the rhomboids and levator scapulae, arises from the C5 nerve root. The long thoracic nerve, which innervates the serratus anterior, arises from the C5 to C7 roots. – Trunks The ventral rami of the C5 to T1 nerve roots join to form the trunks of the brachial plexus. The upper (or superior) trunk, formed from the C5 and C6 nerve roots, gives off two branches: the suprascapular nerve, which innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and the nerve to subclavius. The point where the C5 and C6 nerve roots meet is called Erb’s point. The middle trunk is formed from the C7 root. There are no branches from the middle trunk. The lower (inferior trunk) is formed from the C8 and T1 roots. There are no branches from the inferior trunk. The trunks then divide into anterior and posterior divisions. – Cords and nerves The cords are named according to their relationship to the axillary artery. 725 Figure 9.5 Brachial plexus anatomy diagram. (Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted with permission of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.) The lateral cord is formed from the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunk, and therefore carries fibers from C5 to C7. The lateral cord gives rise to the lateral pectoral nerve, which innervates the pectoralis major. The lateral cord ends as two nerves, the median nerve (which also receives a contribution from the medial cord), discussed further in question 23, and the musculocutaneous nerve, which contains the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and is further discussed in question 67. The posterior cord is formed from the posterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunk, and therefore carries fibers from C5 to T1. Three nerves arise from the posterior cord: (1) the upper subscapular nerve, which contains predominantly C7 and C8 fibers and innervates the subscapularis; (2) the lower subscapular nerve, which contains C5 and C6 fibers and innervates the teres major and the lower part of the subscapularis; and (3) the thoracodorsal nerve, which contains C6, C7, and C8 fibers and innervates the latissimus dorsi. The posterior cord ends as two nerves, the axillary 726 nerve, which is discussed further in question 69, and the radial nerve, which is discussed further in question 43. The medial cord is a continuation of the lower (inferior) trunk. The medial cord gives off three nerves: (1) the medial pectoral nerve, which contains predominantly C8 and T1 fibers and innervates the pectoralis minor; (2) the medial brachial cutaneous nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the medial arm; and (3) the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the medial forearm. The medial cord gives fibers to the median nerve and then continues as the ulnar nerve, which is discussed further in question 37. As discussed and shown in Figure 9.5 , both the dorsal scapular nerve and the long thoracic nerve arise directly from the ventral (anterior) rami of the nerve roots. Russell SM.

Symptoms include lancinating pains and dysesthesias, and autonomic dysfunction, including sexual dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, urinary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anhidrosis, and pupillary abnormalities. Cardiac and renal involvement may occur from amyloid deposition in these organs. Nerve, rectal, or fat pad biopsy with congo red staining demonstrates amyloid, which exhibits an apple-green birefringence on polarized light; transthyretin molecular gene testing is also available for diagnosis. Liver transplant may be helpful for FAPs resulting from transthyretin mutations. FAP2, as depicted in question 19, manifests later than FAP1, in the fourth and fifth decades, and its main features are carpal tunnel syndrome and a slowly progressive polyneuropathy, with absence of autonomic features. FAP3 and FAP4 are rare and not related to abnormalities in transthyretin. FAP3 is similar to FAP1 in clinical manifestations, but with earlier renal involvement and more gastrointestinal involvement, with a higher incidence of duodenal ulcers. Other features may include hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction. It results from abnormalities in the apolipoprotein A1 gene. FAP4 manifests in the third decade of life, with corneal dystrophy being a prominent early feature. In later life, cranial neuropathies and skin changes occur; cranial nerves VII, VIII, and XII are commonly affected. Other features include a peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome without autonomic signs or symptoms. FAP4 results from abnormalities in the amyloid protein gelsolin. The FAPs are distinguished on the basis of family history and laboratory testing from primary systemic amyloidosis (which results from deposition of AL amyloid, and is associated with monoclonal protein), and secondary amyloidosis (which results from deposition of AA amyloid, and occurs in the setting of systemic inflammatory diseases).

      "explicacao": "The demyelinating CMTs include CMT1 and CMTX. CMT4, discussed in question 39, involves both demyelination and axon loss. In the demyelinating CMTs, NCS generally show diffuse, uniformly slow conduction velocities without conduction blocks or temporal dispersion, indicating a hereditary as opposed to acquired demyelinating process (discussed in question 12). There may be evidence of axon loss in the demyelinating forms as well, particularly in patients with long-standing disease; this is secondary axon loss, and conduction velocities as well as CMAP and SNAP amplitudes will be reduced. In contrast, with the axonal forms, motor and sensory potential amplitudes will be reduced, but conduction velocities will be normal or minimally reduced (discussed in question 3, 4, and 13). At the time of this publication, there were seven subtypes of CMT1; they are all inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. CMT1A is the most common inherited demyelinating neuropathy. Clinical manifestations typically begin in the first two decades of life and include slowly progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, kyphosis, and mild (often asymptomatic) sensory loss. Other signs include hammertoes, high-arched feet, palpably enlarged nerves due to peripheral nerve hypertrophy (which more commonly occurs in the CMT1 group compared to the other CMTs), and pes cavus. Involvement of the upper extremities typically occurs later in life. There is often a family history of neuropathy, though due to variable expression, some affected family members may only have mild features such as hammertoes and may remain undiagnosed for a large part of their life; sporadic cases without a clear family history also exist. Other forms of CMT may be congenital and severe. In the CMT1 group, many of the genes involved are related to myelin synthesis. CMT1A is due to a duplication in the peripheral myelin protein 22 ( PMP22 ) gene on chromosome 17, whereas CMT1B is due to a mutation in the myelin protein 0 gene. CMT1B is more severe in terms of clinical manifestations as compared to CMT1A. In patients with CMT1, CSF shows elevated protein levels in some cases. Roussy–Levy syndrome is phenotypically similar to CMT1A but is associated with the presence of a static tremor and gait ataxia. It has been associated with mutations in both the PMP22 and myelin protein 0 genes. 730 On nerve biopsy, pathologic features of the demyelinating inherited polyneuropathies include demyelination and an onion- bulb appearance due to Schwann cell proliferation. Onion bulbs are not specific for CMT, and also occur with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (discussed in questions 11, 12, and 38). CMTX is the second most common type of CMT. It is demyelinating and is clinically similar to CMT1, but it is X-linked in inheritance; males therefore tend to be more severely affected compared to females. It is due to a mutation in the connexin 32 gene. CMT2 accounts for approximately one-third of the autosomal dominant inherited neuropathies. The CMT2 subtypes are axonal neuropathies; NCS show normal conduction velocities, and nerve biopsy shows axon loss without evidence of significant demyelination. Compared to CMT1, in CMT2, symptoms and signs typically appear later and foot and spine deformities are less severe. Clinical manifestations do not always help distinguish the different CMTs, but some clinical features occur more frequently in the different subtypes. Optic atrophy occurs more in CMT2A2, foot ulcerations in CMT2B, and vocal cord paralysis, intercostal, and diaphragmatic weakness in CMT2C. In CMT2D, unlike in the other CMTs, the hands are involved more than the feet. Peripheral nerve hypertrophy does not occur. They are all autosomal dominant in inheritance, except for a subtype of CMT2A. The genes implicated in the CMT2 group are involved in axonal transport and membrane trafficking. CMT2A2 is one of the most common of this group and is due to mutations in mitofusin 2. CMT3, also known as Dejerine–Sottas syndrome or hypertrophic neuropathy of infancy, is one of the more severe forms of the demyelinating CMTs. It presents in infancy with proximal weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hypertrophy of the peripheral nerves. Prominent sensory symptoms including pain and dysesthesias occur. Patients typically have extensive disability early in life. Both autosomal recessive and dominant forms exist. CSF protein is usually elevated. Congenital hypomyelination is seen along the spectrum of this disorder. CMT3 is genetically heterogeneous; mutations in several genes including PMP22, 731 protein myelin 0, and other genes implicated in defective demyelination are associated with CMT3. CMT4 is discussed in question 39. Clinical features of some of CMT4 subtypes include vision loss, severe scoliosis, and hearing loss. The CMTs can be misdiagnosed as muscular dystrophy; NCS findings, as well as the presence of hammertoes and high-arched foot, help distinguish between the two.

All Rights Reserved.) The lumbar plexus is formed by contributions from T12 to L4 and gives rise to three major and three minor nerves. The three minor nerves are the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genitofemoral. The first two arise from a common trunk originating from L1 with some contributions from T12. The genitofemoral nerve arises from L1 and L2. The three major nerves are the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve originates from L2 and L3 (discussed in question 47). The femoral nerve originates from the posterior divisions of L2, L3, and L4 (see question 29 and Fig. 9.7 ). The obturator nerve originates from the anterior divisions of L2, L3, and L4 and divides into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior division gives innervation to the adductor brevis, 735 adductor longus, and gracilis muscles. The posterior division gives innervation to the obturator externus and a portion of the adductor magnus, which is also innervated by the sciatic nerve. The lumbosacral trunk is a structure that originates from L4 and L5 and joins the sacral plexus to form the sciatic nerve, which is not only the largest nerve of the lumbosacral plexus, but the largest nerve in the body.

The anterior divisions of L4 through S3 736 contribute to form the tibial division of the sciatic nerve. The posterior divisions from L4 through S2 contribute to the common peroneal division of the sciatic nerve. The superior gluteal nerve originates from L4, L5, and S1 and innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. These muscles contribute to thigh abduction, with the tensor fasciae latae acting as the main abductor when the hip is flexed, and the gluteus medius and minimus acting as the main abductors when the hip is extended. The inferior gluteal nerve originates from L5, S1, and S2 and innervates the gluteus maximus, which is an extensor of the thigh. The posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh originates from S1, S2, and S3 and gives sensory cutaneous innervation to the lower buttock and posterior thigh. The pudendal nerve originates from S2, S3, and S4 and provides sensory innervation to the perineal region and perianal region through the inferior rectal nerve, perineal nerve, and dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris.

The femoral nerve can be injured in the retroperitoneal or intrapelvic space, or at the inguinal ligament. Clinically, the distinction between injury at these sites can be made by detection of weakness on hip flexion, reflecting psoas compromise, and electrophysiologically by the presence of fibrillations in the iliacus muscle. Both these muscles are innervated proximal to the inguinal ligament, and their compromise will suggest an intrapelvic injury rather than an inguinal injury. At the inguinal region, the femoral nerve can be damaged by inguinal masses or hematomas, during hip surgery or perineal surgeries, especially associated with prolonged lithotomy position, such as in this case. It is important to distinguish femoral nerve injury from L2-L3-L4 radiculopathy and lumbar plexopathy. The presence of impairment of other nerves will suggest these possible diagnoses. For example, adductor weakness suggests involvement of the obturator nerve, which can occur in L2-L3-L4 radiculopathy or a lumbar plexopathy. Also, the presence of weakness in the distal lower extremity muscles will imply injury to other nerves, excluding a selective femoral nerve injury. Abnormal SNAPs do not correlate with a radiculopathy from an intraspinal canal lesion, because SNAPs will be normal in these lesions (discussed in questions 3, 4, and 6).

Certain antibodies have been found to correlate with characteristic clinical presentations, and it is thought that these antibodies are directed against the nervous system, either peripheral or central. Anti-Hu (also known as ANNA-1) antibody is typically associated with peripheral neuropathy and sensory neuronopathy in the setting of small cell lung cancer, and will most likely be positive in this case, though anti-Hu antibody has been associated with a variety of other neurologic manifestations as well. Anti–voltage-gated calcium channel is present in Lambert– Eaton myasthenic syndrome in association with small cell lung cancer (discussed in Chapter 10 ). Anti-Yo is present in ovarian carcinoma and other malignancies, and manifests with cerebellar degeneration. Anti-Ri is associated with opsoclonus–myoclonus with or without ataxia in the setting of neoplasms of the lung or breast. Anti-MAG antibodies are antibodies against myelin- associated glycoprotein and are associated with demyelinating neuropathy in the setting of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (discussed in Chapter 16 ).

In the thigh, the tibial division of the sciatic nerve gives innervation to the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, long head of the biceps femoris, and adductor magnus. The peroneal division of the sciatic nerve gives a branch to the short head of the biceps femoris in the thigh. Proximal to the popliteal fossa, the sciatic nerve bifurcates into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. Abnormalities in the short head of the biceps femoris help distinguish a sciatic nerve lesion from a common peroneal lesion at the fibular head, as the short head of the biceps femoris is spared in the latter. The tibial nerve gives off the sural nerve that provides sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the leg and foot. The tibial nerve then continues down the leg, innervating the gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. At the medial ankle, the tibial nerve passes through the tarsal tunnel and gives three terminal branches: (1) the calcaneal, (2) medial plantar, and (3) lateral plantar nerves. The common peroneal nerve runs around the fibular head from posterior to anterior and divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The superficial peroneal innervates the peroneus longus and brevis, as well as the skin in the lower two-thirds of the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot. The deep peroneal innervates the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, and peroneus tertius ( Table 9.4 ). The sensory territory of the deep peroneal nerve is the web space between the first and second toes. In this patient, both tibial and peroneal nerve–innervated muscles are affected, including the short head of the biceps femoris, suggesting a sciatic nerve lesion, rather than individual tibial or peroneal nerve involvement. The fact that the sural and superficial peroneal SNAPs are affected excludes the possibility of a radiculopathy. Finally, the conspicuous lack of involvement of gluteal nerve–innervated muscles makes the diagnosis of a lumbosacral plexopathy unlikely. The final diagnosis is thus a sciatic mononeuropathy. 743 Figure 9.8 Sciatic nerve anatomy diagram. (Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI.

Flexor pollicis brevis is innervated by both the median and ulnar nerve, so even with complete ulnar palsy some thumb abduction can still be achieved by the part of the muscle innervated by the median nerve. When asked to make a fist, the hand assumes the appearance of a claw, with the fourth and fifth digits hyperextended at the metacarpophalangeal joint and partially flexed at the interphalangeal joint. This occurs because the third and fourth lumbricals as well as the interossei and flexor digiti minimi are weak, and there is unopposed action of the radial nerve–innervated muscles (Table 9.6), causing hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Other signs seen with ulnar nerve palsy include (1) Wartenberg’s sign, or fifth digit abduction at rest due to paralysis of the third palmar interossei with unopposed action of extensor digiti minimi and extensor digitorum communis (radial nerve–innervated muscles), and (2) Froment’s sign, whereby during attempted forceful adduction of the thumb, as with an attempt to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and the index finger, thumb flexion occurs. This occurs because the adductor pollicis is weak, and thumb flexion (by the intact flexor pollicis longus) is the compensatory action. In the case described, reduction in CMAP amplitude of more than 50% with stimulation above as compared to below the elbow (see Fig. 9.4 ) further supports the diagnosis. Ulnar nerve compression at the wrist, at Guyon’s canal, may occur in bicycle riders or others who frequently place pressure at the medial wrist area. Claw hand, Wartenberg’s sign, and Froment’s sign can all be seen with ulnar neuropathy at Guyon’s canal. Involvement of flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus (which receive motor branches from the ulnar nerve in the forearm) indicate that the lesion is proximal to the wrist. In addition, with lesions at or distal to the wrist, sensation over the hypothenar eminence is spared because the palmar cutaneous branch arises proximal to Guyon’s canal. With a lesion at the wrist, CMAP amplitudes would be abnormally low with stimulation at the wrist, and a reduction in CMAP amplitude would not occur with more proximal stimulation. 753 In the case presented in question 41, other C8-innervated muscles such as the flexor digitorum profundus to the second digit are of normal strength, and forearm pronation is normal, providing evidence that this is not a C7 or C8 radiculopathy. Intact sensation proximal to the wrist excludes a proximal medial cord lesion; when sensory loss extends 2 cm or more proximal to the wrist, the territory innervated by the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (which branches directly off the medial cord), involvement of the medial cord should be suspected. Another feature distinguishing an ulnar nerve palsy from a medial cord lesion is intact strength of median nerve-innervated C8 and T1 muscles, such as flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and the median nerve–innervated lumbricals (see Table 9.1 ). 754 Table 9.6 Upper Extremity Muscles Innervated by the Radial Nerve, Their Root Innervation, and Action Russell SM.

Proximal radial nerve lesions are not common, but can occur with repetitive pressure to the axilla, as occurs with prolonged crutch use, or with prolonged pressure otherwise on the axilla, as occurs in “Saturday night palsy,” when a person sleeps with his or her arm hung over the back of a chair. Although the triceps reflex (C7) is absent, intact forearm pronation suggests that pronator teres, which is predominantly innervated by the C7 nerve root, is normal, excluding a C7 radiculopathy. Intact arm abduction, mediated in large part by axillary nerve–innervated muscles, excludes a posterior cord lesion. With posterior cord lesions, muscles innervated by both the axillary and radial nerves are weak. The patient in question 62 has a history and examination consistent with a radial neuropathy at the spiral groove. Intact strength of the triceps and intact sensation on the posterior aspect of the arm support that the lesion is distal to origin of the posterior cutaneous nerve to the arm and branches to triceps, excluding a proximal radial nerve lesion or a posterior cord lesion; intact triceps strength and normal triceps deep tendon reflex are evidence that this is not a C7 radiculopathy. Reduced sensation over the lateral aspect of the arm suggests that the lesion is more proximal than the elbow, as the lateral cutaneous nerve to the arm arises from the radial nerve within the spiral groove. The spiral groove is the most common location for radial nerve injury, and a common mechanism is humeral fracture. Other choices are excluded on the basis of the discussion above. Russell SM.

Jugular foramen syndrome, or Vernet’s syndrome, results from compressive lesions of the foramen magnum, such as metastases or schwannomas, and there would be evidence of involvement of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves in addition to the spinal accessory nerve (see Chapter 1 ). The cervical plexus consists of the ventral rami of C1 to C4. The cervical plexus provides innervation to several neck muscles including the levator scapula (C3 and C4), which significantly contributes to shoulder shrug (along with trapezius), allowing relatively preserved shoulder shrug strength in the setting of trapezial weakness. The cervical plexus is also the origin of the nerves that supply sensory innervation to the posterior head and neck regions, including the lesser occipital nerves that provide sensation to the area posterior to the ear, the greater occipital nerves, which carry predominantly C2 fibers and provide sensory innervation to most of the posterior head, the greater auricular nerves, and the transverse cervical nerves.

      "explicacao": "heterogeneous group of hereditary neuropathies. As a group, they share in common prominent sensory signs and symptoms, including pain, sensory loss, and autonomic features with little motor involvement. Because of the sensory loss, patients with HSANs are prone to painful calluses, stress fractures, neuropathic (Charcot) joints, skin ulcerations that heal poorly, and infections with deep tissue involvement, such as osteomyelitis, leading to disfiguring acral mutilations. Question 75 depicts HSAN1. HSAN1 is the most common HSAN. It is autosomal dominant. Presentation is typically in young adulthood. Painful sensory symptoms such as lancinating pains are prominent. There is relatively dissociated sensory loss, with pain and temperature affected more than dorsal column modalities. The main autonomic manifestation is hypohidrosis. Only in advanced cases do muscle weakness and atrophy occur. Hearing loss can rarely occur. HSAN1 results from a mutation in the gene encoding for serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of sphingolipid synthesis. HSAN2 begins in infancy, and is characterized by generalized loss of sensation and insensitivity to pain, leading to significant risk of mutilation to the hands, feet, lips, and tongue. Autonomic symptoms are not prominent and cognitive function is normal. Associated features include areflexia and retinitis pigmentosa. NCS show evidence of axon loss, with absence of SNAPs. Question 76 depicts HSAN3, also known as familial dysautonomia or Riley–Day syndrome, an autosomal recessive HSAN with prominent autonomic features. Symptom onset is in infancy with dysphagia, vomiting, recurrent infections, and blood pressure lability. It is particularly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews. With emotional stimulation, there is hyperhidrosis, skin flushing, and hypertension. Other autonomic features include absence of lacrimation. The tongue may be smooth due to absence of fungiform papillae. Later in life, evidence of a predominantly sensory neuropathy with insensitivity to pain occurs, as well as areflexia. Nerve biopsy shows a marked reduction in the density of unmyelinated axons and small myelinated axons, with a reduction in autonomic ganglia cell bodies. HSAN3 is due to a mutation in the IKAP gene, which results in abnormal mRNA splicing, leading 779 to dysregulation of neural endocytosis. Question 77 depicts HSAN4, or congenital insensitivity to pain. This is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by insensitivity to pain, leading to repeated injury and self-mutilation. Cognitive delay is also present, as are significant behavioral problems including hyperactivity. Autonomic features include anhidrosis, leading to heat intolerance and frequent fevers. There is little evidence of large-fiber sensory or motor neuropathy on examination or EMG/NCS; diagnosis is made by demonstration of absent or a markedly reduced number of unmyelinated axons and small myelinated fibers on skin biopsy, absence of nerve endings in sweat glands, as well as absence of sweating by quantitative sudomotor axon-reflex test. This disorder results from mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor for nerve growth factor NTRK1, which plays a role in the development of unmyelinated nociceptive and sudomotor fibers. Prominence of sensory features with relatively few motor manifestations and the presence of autonomic signs and symptoms distinguish the HSANs from Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT). CMT1A does not typically include features of early prominent dysphagia or autonomic dysfunction, but other features are present, as discussed in questions 21 and 22.

These episodes may be precipitated by exposure to either heat or cold. Patients are typically asymptomatic between episodes. This disorder is due to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN9A gene, which results in hyperactivity of the dorsal root ganglia. In the patient presented in question 80, the family history and normal routine laboratory testing make primary erythromelalgia the more likely diagnosis. However, there are secondary causes of erythromelalgia that warrant consideration in the appropriate clinical context. Secondary erythromelalgia can be seen with polycythemia rubra vera and other myeloproliferative disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune disorders. Some secondary causes of erythromelalgia respond to aspirin therapy. Note that Fabry’s disease is on the differential diagnosis of erythromelalgia as Fabry’s can lead to painful acroparesthesias that are worsened with heat exposure and exercise, but evidence of small-fiber neuropathy on examination and other findings on history and examination distinguish between these two disorders (discussed in question 70). There is no evidence of small-fiber neuropathy due to glucose intolerance, and the episodic nature of the symptoms further excludes that diagnosis. The episodic nature of the symptoms with normal examination otherwise is evidence that this is not hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

It may be associated with other neoplasms, such as neuroendocrine tumors, lymphomas, breast and ovarian cancers, and sarcomas. Another condition that typically can cause sensory neuronopathy is Sjogren’s syndrome, which is a condition characterized by inflammation of the exocrine glands leading to keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia (discussed in Chapter 16 ). The diagnostic work-up includes Schirmer’s test, SSA and SSB antibodies, and lip biopsy to detect inflammatory changes in small salivary glands.

      "explicacao": "Symptoms typically manifest in early adulthood, with females being more commonly and more severely affected as compared to males. Symptoms typically begin with abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by neurologic symptoms, including most prominently manifestations of autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile hypertension, orthostasis, and urinary retention). Neuropsychiatric symptoms including psychosis occur, and seizures may be present as well. In some patients, a subacute predominantly motor neuropathy occurs; the arms may be affected prior to the legs, and proximal muscles are involved more than distal muscles. Involvement of the radial nerve in isolation may occur. The neuropathy is both axonal and demyelinating. Cranial nerve involvement, and even respiratory muscle involvement leading to respiratory failure, may occur. In AIP, photosensitivity is not present, whereas with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, photosensitivity with skin blistering and hyperpigmentation occur. During an attack, elevated levels of porphobilinogen and aminolevulinic acid are detectable in the urine and serum. Elevated protoporphyrinogen and coproporphyrinogen in the stool distinguish variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria from AIP. Management of the porphyrias involves prevention of attacks by avoidance of drugs that may precipitate the attack (including antiepileptics, particularly barbiturates) and other triggers. Treatment of attacks includes supportive care, a high-carbohydrate diet, and in some cases hematin, which suppresses δ-ALA synthase activity. Although Wilson’s disease is on the differential diagnosis of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not typically lead to peripheral motor mononeuropathies or abdominal pain, except in the setting of hepatic impairment, and there is no evidence of liver disease in the case presented (see Chapter 6 for more on Wilson’s disease). The history presented is not consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (discussed in Chapter 7 ), in which the MRI would be abnormal, or acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (discussed in questions 15, 16, 24, 55, and 56). Although systemic lupus erythematosus can lead to a 785 similar clinical picture, normal MRI of the brain and CSF analysis, and lack of other manifestations of lupus make this diagnosis less likely.

Myasthenia gravis may present with a myriad of symptoms; the hallmarks are fluctuations and fatigability, with weakness worsening with increased muscle use. Ocular muscles are most commonly involved, with ptosis and diplopia as the presenting symptom in 70% to 90% of cases. Up to 80% of such patients generalize to involve bulbar, limb, neck, and/or respiratory muscles within 2 years. In a minority (10% to 15%), involvement remains restricted to the eyes, so-called ocular myasthenia. Other patients present with predominantly bulbar symptoms due to involvement of muscles of mastication, speech, swallowing, and facial expression, leading to weakness and/or fatigability of chewing, dysphagia, and/or dysarthria. Limb and neck weakness may also occur. Myasthenic crisis (discussed in questions 15–16), or respiratory failure due to involvement of respiratory muscles, can be the presenting symptom, but more commonly occurs in those with exacerbation of symptoms in the setting of stressors such as infection or surgery. Myasthenia gravis is more common in family members of patients with this disorder. It has been associated with human leukocyte antigen types B8, DR1, DR2, and DR3. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at an increased risk of other autoimmune disorders including thyroid disorders, and these should be tested for as clinically indicated. Amato AA, Russell JA.

      "explicacao": "striational muscle antibodies can be positive in myasthenia patients with thymoma, but they are much less sensitive and specific than acetylcholine receptor antibodies for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The patient’s clinical picture, rather than antibody levels, is used to monitor response to therapy. In approximately half of all patients who are seronegative for antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, anti–muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies are present (discussed in question 27). EMG findings in myasthenia gravis include electrodecremental response and jitter. The presence of a 10% or greater decrement in amplitude of a CMAP between the first and fourth to fifth stimuli with repetitive nerve stimulation suggests an NMJ disorder (see Chapter 9 ). If there is not an abnormality present on repetitive nerve stimulation but there is a high clinical suspicion for myasthenia gravis and it cannot be confirmed with serologic testing, a single-fiber EMG can be performed. Single-fiber EMG is the most sensitive test of NMJ transmission. Jitter is the variability in the measure of interpotential difference between two muscle fiber action potentials during consecutive discharges of the same motor unit. Increased jitter (or increased interpotential time) is present in patients with NMJ abnormalities, but is not specific for myasthenia gravis. Blocking on single-fiber EMG is failure of a single muscle fiber action potential to appear during the motor unit discharge, and occurs when there is significantly increased jitter.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "possible dose in myasthenia gravis; symptom exacerbation with initiation of any medication should prompt investigation as to whether or not the medication is the culprit. Penicillamine can cause a seropositive myasthenic syndrome. The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis, except some with purely ocular myasthenia, require immunosuppressive therapy. Patients are often treated with corticosteroids for several weeks to months until secondary immunosuppressive therapy has taken effect. Approximately one-third of patients will have worsening of their myasthenic symptoms at the onset of steroid therapy that lasts up to 10 days. Therefore, caution is required with the initiation of steroid therapy. When symptoms are severe, and there is concern for significant pharyngeal or respiratory muscle involvement, initiation of plasma exchange or IVIGs prior to starting corticosteroids may be necessary. Secondary immunosuppressive agents that may be used include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine. Their use helps reduce the need for steroids in the long term. Pyridostigmine provides symptomatic relief but does not modify the course of the illness. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are discussed in question 22. In the majority of patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis, thymic abnormalities are present, most commonly lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. In a minority of patients, benign thymoma is present, and rarely, malignant thymoma. Resection of the thymus (regardless of whether or not thymoma is present) can potentially induce remission of myasthenia gravis. In autoimmune myasthenia gravis, there are ongoing clinical trials to determine the utility of thymectomy. However, there is evidence that patients who undergo thymectomy are more likely to attain remission of their myasthenia gravis. Thymectomy is therefore recommended for patients with myasthenia gravis with symptom onset prior to the age of 60, especially in younger women who seem to show the most benefit. Response to resection may not be apparent for several months to years. Because myasthenic symptoms can worsen in the perioperative period, stabilization of symptoms with preoperative IVIGs or plasma exchange prior to operation may be indicated. 838 Cortese I, Chaudhry V, So YT, et al.

Serum creatine kinase levels may be normal or elevated. The muscle biopsy specimen shown in Figure 10.3 is characteristic for dermatomyositis, showing atrophic fibers in the borders of the fascicles, which is known as perifascicular atrophy. Dermatomyositis is associated with malignancy and therefore these patients should have age-appropriate malignancy screening. Dermatomyositis is also associated with interstitial lung disease, especially if the anti-Jo antibody is positive. Anti-Jo antibodies occur more commonly in polymyositis than dermatomyositis but can occur in either condition. The initial treatment of choice is steroids; however, long-term steroid-sparing agents may be required, such as azathioprine or methotrexate. As mentioned above, methotrexate may be associated with pulmonary toxicity, and therefore if there is interstitial lung disease, this medication should be avoided.

His wife had checked his blood pressure once in the early morning and had found it to be 180/90 mm Hg. As soon as he would get out of bed, the “woozy” feeling would occur and would typically last throughout the day. His blood pressure during the day was as low as 80/60 mm Hg when standing. He felt particularly symptomatic after eating and when the weather was warm. He had lost consciousness twice in prior months; all episodes were triggered by changes in posture. He also had a 1-year history of impotence. He also reported frequent nocturia, urinary hesitancy, and urgency. Besides demonstration of orthostasis on vital signs testing, his examination is entirely normal, with no evidence of ataxia or rigidity and normal sensory examination. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg, or both), or a pulse rate increase of 20 bpm, is present, and is often worse in the morning, after meals, exertion, and with heat exposure. Supine hypertension may occur as well. Other features include hypohidrosis, nocturia, early satiety and nausea (due to gastrointestinal hypomotility), urinary hesitance and/or urgency with occasional incontinence, and neck and shoulder aching (“coat hanger” distribution) precipitated by standing. In multiple system atrophy (discussed in Chapter 6 ), dysautonomia is typically more severe and disabling, and extrapyramidal or cerebellar findings are present on examination. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is discussed in questions 24 and 25. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy type I can lead to autonomic neuropathy (see Chapter 9 ), but the history and examination (specifically, absence of dissociated sensory loss on examination) make this less likely. This patient is not known to have diabetes, and a normal sensory examination further makes diabetic autonomic neuropathy unlikely. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "discontinuation of the medication. • Muscle weakness with serum CK elevation. • Rhabdomyolysis. This is a rare but severe complication of statins. In this condition, the CK levels are markedly elevated, sometimes above 15,000 IU/L (normal up to 220 IU/L). These CK elevations could lead to myoglobinuria and renal failure, such as in this case. • Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM). Usually characterized by a rapid onset of severe proximal weakness, and CK levels of typically over 6,000 IU/L. Distal weakness and dysphagia may also occur. Weakness is progressive with rising CK levels despite discontinuation of statin. Antibodies against HMGCR have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. This is an aggressive myopathy and needs to be treated with immunosuppressive agents. NAM can also be associated with antibodies against signal recognition peptide (SRP), which is discussed further in question 67. Myotoxicity with statins increases with higher cholesterol- lowering potency of the statin, with higher statin dosages, and for statins with higher lipophilicity (the lipophilic statins include atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, whereas pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin are more hydrophilic). Concomitant use of fibrates can increase the risk of developing muscle toxicity. This risk can also be increased by the use of other drugs, such as azole antifungals, macrolides antibiotics, antiretrovirals, and amiodarone, among others. Therefore a careful assessment of the medications that the patient is taking is important when treating a patient with statins. Babu S, Li Y. Statin induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), the most common form of dysautonomia. Tilt table examination is used to assess changes in heart rate and blood pressure that occur with changes in posture, increased vagal tone (as occurs with Valsalva), and sometimes, in response to the administration of pharmacologic agents such as the β-agonist isoproterenol. In POTS, tilt table examination shows an increase in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from baseline, or more than 120 bpm within 10 minutes of head-up tilt, without significant changes in blood pressure, but with symptoms of orthostasis such as light- headedness, palpitations, generalized weakness, visual changes, headache, or tremor. The etiology of POTS is unclear; it is more common in females, and symptoms worsen around menses, suggesting a role for estrogen in the pathophysiology. Symptom onset may follow a variety of triggers, including viral infection, pregnancy, or surgery, and for this reason, autoimmune causes have also been postulated. POTS can rarely be a manifestation of a mutation in a norepinephrine transporter gene, which leads to elevated plasma levels of norepinephrine, with subsequent sympathetic overactivity. POTS may be comorbid with chronic fatigue syndrome; the significance of this relationship is not clear. In some patients with POTS, the symptoms are mild and do not require treatment. In others, treatment may include β-blockers, increased fluid and salt intake, fludrocortisone, and midodrine. There is not a reduction in blood pressure in POTS, distinguishing it from orthostatic hypotension. With vasovagal response, there is no tachycardia but rather transient bradycardia due to parasympathetic overactivation. Systemic mastocytosis, a hematologic disorder in which mast cells are overactive, leading to excessive histamine release, can lead to POTS-like symptoms; skin changes such as flushing and an absence of clear postural component distinguish the two. Subclavian steal syndrome results in syncope in the setting of stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. With exercise of that arm, blood flow steal from the vertebral arteries and basilar artery may occur, resulting in syncope and other symptoms of basilar insufficiency. There is no indication in the case that the symptoms are secondary to subclavian steal phenomenon. 855 Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Ocular muscle weakness occurs, resulting in strabismus and diplopia. Also, weakness of the tongue and masticatory as well as pharyngeal muscles occurs, which may cause dysarthria and dysphagia. Limb muscle weakness occurs, more prominent proximally. The diaphragm and cardiac muscles may also be involved. Myopathic symptoms eventually subside and patients generally improve completely. However, massive infections have been reported to cause CNS symptoms, including headaches, neck stiffness, and confusion. Laboratory studies demonstrate eosinophilia and moderate elevations of CK. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay blood test for trichinella becomes positive after 1 to 2 weeks and may be helpful. Muscle biopsy, such as in this case, as shown in Figure 10.7 , will demonstrate the parasite and sometimes an inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils.

If there is early, gradual, and sustained hypotension (>20 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure) without compensatory tachycardia, this is an indication of insufficient sympathetic tone and impaired baroreceptor function. Hypotension with compensatory tachycardia suggests hypovolemia. If hypotension is delayed for several minutes but then occurs abruptly with bradycardia, this is more suggestive of a neurocardiogenic mechanism. Most neurogenic causes of syncope lead to hypotension that occurs within the first 5 to 10 minutes of tilting, without a compensatory tachycardia. The thermoregulatory sweat test is a test of sudomotor function; it is a qualitative test of sweating in which an indicator powder is applied to the subject who is then exposed to elevated temperatures. Sweat interacts with the powder, and the distribution pattern of the powder indicates areas of normal sweating and identifies areas of absent or reduced sweating. Different patterns of hypo- or anhidrosis can be identified that correspond to different autonomic disorders. In large and small fiber neuropathies, distal anhidrosis occurs. In patients with multiple system atrophy (see Chapter 6 ), pure autonomic failure (discussed in question 34), and autonomic neuropathies, global hypohidrosis or anhidrosis occurs. The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test is another test of sudomotor function. A sweat cell is applied to the skin and an electric current is then applied. Acetylcholine is iontophoresed into the skin, stimulating sweat glands. Sweat production is measured from adjacent sweat glands that are stimulated via an axon reflex.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination are consistent with congenital myasthenia due to congenital acetylcholine receptor deficiency, a congenital myasthenic syndrome. The congenital myasthenic syndromes are a genetically heterogeneous group of neuromuscular junction disorders. They most commonly present at birth, but some forms do not present until childhood or early adulthood. They are more common in males. The typical presentation is one of ophthalmoparesis and ptosis in infancy, with facial diparesis. Limb weakness and hypotonia are often present, and respiratory involvement is rare but can occur. As in autoimmune myasthenia gravis, in some forms of congenital myasthenia, intravenous administration of edrophonium (a peripheral reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) transiently improves symptoms, and there is symptomatic benefit from oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as well. Because the congenital myasthenic syndromes are not immune-mediated, there is no response to immunosuppressive therapy or thymectomy. Electrophysiologic findings are similar to other neuromuscular disorders, showing a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation studies and increased jitter on single-fiber EMG. The most common form of congenital myasthenia, congenital acetylcholine receptor deficiency, is due to an autosomal recessive or sporadic mutation in the acetylcholine receptor gene. Acetylcholinesterase deficiency is another congenital myasthenic syndrome that presents with axial and respiratory weakness in early infancy. Characteristically, patients have a delayed pupillary response to direct light. Due to deficiency of the enzyme, these patients do not respond to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as edrophonium or pyridostigmine. In newborns of mothers with autoimmune myasthenia gravis, transient myasthenic symptoms can occur due to transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus in utero. Signs of neonatal myasthenia include hypotonia and poor feeding, with symptoms improving typically within the first 2 weeks of life. This patient’s symptoms and examination findings are still present at 6 months of age, and absence of evidence of a neuromuscular disorder in the patient’s mother makes this less likely. Other disorders that can lead to ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, and 866 generalized weakness in infancy include mitochondrial disorders, botulism, and congenital myopathies, but the presence of fluctuating weakness and response to edrophonium distinguish congenital myasthenia from these.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "muscles in the upper eyelid are also carried along this route. Sympathetic fibers destined for the eccrine glands of the face travel along the ECA. Horner’s syndrome, or oculosympathetic paresis, results from a lesion to the sympathetic pathways. Features include ptosis, due to loss of innervation of Muller’s smooth muscle, miosis, due to loss of innervation of the pupillary dilator muscle, apparent enophthalmos, due to lack of input to the lid retractors (the eye appears sunken, though it is not), and loss of ciliospinal reflex (absence of pupillary constriction when painful stimulation is applied to the cervical region ipsilateral to the lesion). In preganglionic lesions, such as those occurring from medullary infarction, during thoracotomy, or with large lung masses that impinge on the preganglionic fibers as they course toward the superior cervical ganglion, facial anhidrosis occurs as well. Lesions in the region of the ICA (such as ICA dissection) spare the fibers destined for the eccrine glands of the face (traveling with the ECA), and anhidrosis does not occur. The patient in question 55 has a Horner’s syndrome, and in the setting of smoking, chronic cough and the findings on examination, this suggests that this is due to an apical lung mass, or Pancoast tumor. The presence of anhidrosis makes an ICA dissection unlikely because fibers to facial sweat glands travel along the ECA. The patient in question 56 has an ICA dissection, and because the lesion is distal to branching of the sweat fibers to the face (which are, again, carried along the ECA), anhidrosis will not occur (see also Chapter 1 for further information on how lesions in different areas of the sympathetic pathways can be distinguished). The ptosis and pupillary abnormalities seen in Horner’s syndrome can be distinguished from a third nerve palsy by the presence of intact extraocular movements of cranial nerve III- innervated muscles (medial rectus, inferior oblique, superior rectus, and inferior rectus). In addition, with loss of sympathetic innervation to the pupil, the anisocoria will be more prominent in dim light, as the contralateral (normal) eye will normally dilate, whereas the eye that has lost sympathetic innervation will remain miotic. The miotic eye will still normally constrict to light and accommodation (because parasympathetics are not impaired). 872 Levator dehiscence is a common cause of ptosis in older adults, but pupillary involvement and the other features of Horner’s syndrome would not occur.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "the urethral and anal sphincters. Somatic efferents to the skeletal muscles of the pelvic floor arise from these cells and are carried by the pudendal nerves. Normally, individuals are able to maintain voluntary control over micturition through the medial frontal micturition centers located in the paracentral lobules (the medial continuation of the precentral gyrus). At the initiation of voluntary micturition, the detrusor reflex, which is mediated by spinal cord circuits, is initiated by voluntary external urethral sphincter relaxation and involuntary relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter with detrusor contraction. If the external urethral sphincter is voluntarily contracted during micturition, the detrusor muscle involuntarily relaxes and micturition stops. Urinary incontinence can result from lesions along various areas of the neuraxis. With lesions of the cauda equina (discussed in Chapter 11 ), a flaccid bladder results from loss of detrusor tone, sensation of bladder fullness is lost, and voluntary control over urination is lost. Overflow incontinence may occur; these patients often require intermittent self-catheterization chronically. With lesions affecting the paracentral lobule, such as hydrocephalus or tumors, voluntary control over the external urethral sphincter is lost. Lesions above the conus medullaris lead initially to a flaccid bladder leading to urinary retention with or without overflow incontinence. Some time after a spinal cord lesion, the bladder may become hyperreflexic. Urge incontinence results from overactive detrusor contraction; this is a frequent occurrence in patients with multiple sclerosis, though flaccid bladder with requirements for intermittent catheterization can also occur. Penile erection is mediated by parasympathetic fibers derived from S3 and S4 and carried by the pudendal nerve. Ejaculation is a sympathetically mediated reflex arc: the afferent pathway is via the dorsal nerve of the penis and pudendal nerve to S3 and S4, and the efferent pathway includes the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. A common way to remember this innervation is “Point (Parasympathetics cause erection) and Shoot (Sympathetics cause ejaculation).” Blumenfield H. Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases. 2nd ed.

Clinical manifestations include painless progressive weakness that is more distal in the arms and proximal and distal in the legs. Involvement of the finger flexors and flexor pollicis longus, leading to thumb flexion weakness, with relative preservation of finger abductors (the dorsal interossei) is a classic finding of IBM (see Fig. 10.8 ), although it does not occur in all patients. In contrast to dermatomyositis and polymyositis, deltoid strength is typically preserved in IBM. Nonaka myopathy (discussed in question 21) shows similar histopathologic features to IBM but is hereditary and noninflammatory. In addition in Nonaka myopathy, the pattern of weakness is more distal. In addition to differences discussed above, polymyositis (discussed in question 35), and dermatomyositis (discussed in questions 32–33) are less likely to involve distal musculature compared to IBM.

      "explicacao": "in ALS and do not necessarily suggest an alternative diagnosis. Muscle cramps commonly occur. Only a minority of ALS patients (approximately 1%) present with acute respiratory failure, though the majority progress to respiratory failure. Cognitive impairment of some degree is present in up to 50% of patients with ALS; it is mostly subclinical, but can be detected on neuropsychological testing. In a small proportion of cases, the cognitive dysfunction is more evident, manifesting as a dementia that is typically of the frontotemporal type, namely frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This tends to occur most frequently in patients who present with bulbar-onset ALS. On the other hand, a subset of patients presenting with FTD have clinical and electrodiagnositic features of motor neuron disease. The pathology of patients with so-called ALS-FTD includes atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes and ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43–positive, tau-negative inclusions. Autosomal dominant forms have been linked to TDP-43 gene mutations on chromosome 9. The C9orf72 mutation on chromosome 9 is likely the most common cause of familial FTD- ALS. The region of motor neurons in the sacral spinal cord that are responsible for sphincter control, Onufrowicz’s nucleus (also known as Onuf’s nucleus) is generally spared in ALS, and sphincter dysfunction is typically not a prominent problem. Sensory nerve involvement and dysautonomia are also uncommon in ALS although they can occur. ALS is relentlessly progressive and ultimately fatal within 2 to 5 years of symptom onset, although in approximately 20%, survival is longer than 5 to 10 years after symptom onset. Primary lateral sclerosis (discussed in question 6), progressive muscular atrophy (discussed in question 10), Kennedy’s disease (X- linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy, discussed in question 33), and spinal muscular atrophy (discussed in question 35) are all motor neuron disorders. In these disorders, either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons alone are affected, but not in combination as in ALS. In early ALS, however, combined UMN and LMN dysfunction may be subtle or absent until later stages, when its presence is necessary for diagnosis (by definition; see question 31). In Kennedy’s disease there is often a family history of motor 906 neuron disease in males and gynecomastia is present on examination. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Vitamin B12 deficiency will lead to the accumulation of methylmalonate and propionate, providing abnormal substrates for fatty acid synthesis, and therefore interfering with myelin synthesis. In some cases of vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin B12 levels may be within normal limits. However, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine will be elevated, helping in the diagnosis. Malabsorption is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, and achlorhydria in the setting of pernicious anemia is an important cause. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition in which anti-intrinsic factor and antiparietal antibodies may be present. Given that these patients have achlorhydria, gastrin levels may be elevated as well. Parenteral vitamin B12 supplementation is the treatment of choice in cases of malabsorption, and usually the hematologic abnormalities improve rapidly. However, the neurologic manifestations may not resolve completely. Vitamin B12 levels rise with treatment, regardless of the clinical effect, therefore MMA and homocysteine levels should be followed.

It includes cervical myelopathy, although sensory abnormalities and other features of myelopathy such as bowel and bladder symptoms should be present, and normal MRI of the spine excludes this. Similarly, multiple sclerosis is high on the differential diagnosis of PLS; the presence of sensory symptoms, changes on MRI of the brain and spine, and CSF findings (when CSF is available for analysis), distinguishes between the two. Tropical spastic paraparesis due to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) typically occurs in endemic regions (equatorial and South Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Asia, Central and South America) and rarely in the United States. Patients with hereditary spastic paraparesis often, though not always, have a family history of similar symptoms and signs, and have white matter abnormalities on MRI of the brain and spine. Another condition in the differential diagnosis is stiff person syndrome, which is associated with antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, which should be assessed for in a patient with this presentation. Other disorders that can present with spastic quadriparesis that should be considered include hexosaminidase A deficiency, adrenomyeloneuropathy, a paraneoplastic process, and autoimmune processes (such as Sjogren’s syndrome).

There is no back pain and the upper extremities are typically spared. MRI reveals spinal cord atrophy, but more often is normal. There is no effective treatment, and the initial goal is prevention with antiretroviral therapy. HTLV-1 is a cause of spinal cord involvement in patients with HIV, however is not the cause of HIV-related vacuolar myelopathy.

It is inherited most commonly in an autosomal dominant fashion, but it can occur in an autosomal recessive fashion, while X-linked and sporadic cases have also been reported. This condition can present at any age from childhood to late adulthood, however more frequently the onset is between the second and fourth decades of life. Clinically it has been divided in pure and complicated forms. The pure form presents only with lower extremity spasticity, while sensory and other neurologic functions are intact. The complicated form has other neurologic features, including optic neuropathy, deafness, amyotrophy, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, dementia, mental retardation, and extrapyramidal dysfunction. Several genetic mutations have been identified involving various HSP loci and genes. The most common mutation is in chromosome 2p22 involved with the SPAST gene encoding for the protein spastin, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

Laboratory evaluation may reveal moderately elevated creatine kinase, but never more than 10 times normal, and EMG shows evidence of motor neuron disease. Patients with ALS can present with predominantly lower motor neuron features early in their disease, with upper motor neuron findings not occurring until later. Therefore, a diagnosis of PMA is usually reserved for patients who have electrodiagnostic evidence of motor neuron disease and have isolated lower motor neuron findings at least 3 years from symptom onset. The polio virus infects anterior horn cells, leading to a lower motor neuron pattern of weakness similar to PMA. In those who survive, a post-polio syndrome may emerge years after recovery, marked by progressive fatigue, and weakness in muscles previously affected minimally or seemingly not at all. The history provided in this case is not consistent with post-polio syndrome. Unlike PMA, which progresses, on average, over 3 to 5 years, adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy is even more indolent and often affects predominantly proximal muscles. Inclusion body myositis is on the differential diagnosis of PMA and has a very indolent onset; relatively selective weakness of deep finger flexors and knee extensors in the setting of normal or only slightly elevated (less than two times normal) serum creatine kinase, should prompt workup for this disorder, including EMG and muscle biopsy.

Therefore, an anterior spinal artery infarct will manifest with paraplegia below the level of the infarct, as well as loss of sensation to pain and temperature, but spares the sensation to vibration and proprioception. Option c can be produced by an infarct in the posterior spinal arteries territory, which is uncommon. Option e is consistent with Brown-Séquard (hemisection) syndrome, with ipsilateral loss of motor function and sensation to vibration and proprioception below the level of the lesion, and contralateral loss of sensation to pain and temperature. This happens because the lesion affects the spinothalamic tract after its decussation, and the corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns before the decussation. Options b and d are not likely possible in the setting of this patient. Blumenfeld H. Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases. 1st ed. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates; 2002.

Dural arteriovenous fistula is the most common vascular malformation of the spinal cord, and presents with an insidious and slowly progressive myelopathic syndrome, sometimes with acute exacerbations. These manifestations are caused by increased venous congestion and mass effect in the spinal cord, leading to venous infarcts. Acute hemorrhages may occur, however dural arteriovenous fistulas rarely produce epidural hematomas. The MRI of the spine may show cord signal abnormalities and flow voids, but the definitive diagnostic procedure is conventional angiography. Atherosclerosis, aortic dissection, and aortic manipulation (especially above the renal arteries) are associated with ischemic infarcts of the spinal cord. Prolonged hypotension may be associated with watershed infarcts of the spinal cord. Hypotension, atherosclerosis, and aortic manipulation are not typically associated with spinal epidural hematomas.

The diagnosis is made with serology, CSF antibodies, and/or PCR. The CSF shows neutrophilic pleocytosis with high protein and normal glucose. The MRI shows cauda equina, spinal cord, and/or leptomeningeal enhancement. Pathologic studies have shown perivascular inflammation with anterior horn cell loss in the spinal cord. Many enteroviruses and herpesviruses are associated with a transverse myelitis, usually as a postinfectious phenomenon; there are no features of transverse myelitis in this case. Poliovirus is an enterovirus which can lead to areflexic flaccid paralysis from damage to anterior horn cells, however, poliovirus does not commonly cause the encephalopathic changes seen in WNV, and furthermore it has been eradicated from the United States. This patient does not have history to suggest HIV, which causes a gradually progressive myelopathy characterized by spastic paraparesis with impaired vibration and proprioception sensation, and sensory gait ataxia. The pathologic finding on HIV myelopathy is microvacuolar changes. Myelopathy from HIV is usually a late disease manifestation, and does not seem to be the case in this patient. HTLV-1 is a virus transmitted via sexual, parenteral or maternal routes, which causes a chronic progressive myelopathy known as tropical spastic paraparesis. The myelopathy is usually localized in the thoracic region and pathologically there is neuronal cell loss, microvacuolization, and long tract degeneration. The diagnosis is made by detecting antibodies to HTLV-1 in the serum and CSF, as well as PCR amplification of the DNA of the virus. This virus is also associated with adult T-cell lymphoma and leukemia. HTLV-2 is also associated with a progressive myelopathy and can be seen in native Americans, IV drug users, and patients with HIV, but this is much less common than HTLV-1.

The diagnostic test of choice to determine the presence of neoplastic disease is MRI of the spinal cord with gadolinium. There are multiple treatment options that are selected depending on the underlying neoplasm, degree of neurologic disease, timing of presentation, functional status, and prognosis. Steroids are frequently used, especially in the acute phase of cord compression, with dexamethasone being the most commonly used. Methylprednisolone with a 30 mg/kg bolus and an infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h for 23 hours is a formulation used more commonly in spinal cord traumatic injury, but not for neoplastic disease. Radiation therapy is used for radiosensitive neoplasias, such as lymphoproliferative disease and germ cell tumors, and for various types of metastases, particularly in the setting of cord compression. It may be used as a palliative measure to improve symptoms of pain and other symptoms of cord compression. Surgical resection should be entertained when feasible, even in cases of metastatic disease, where it has shown superiority when combined with radiotherapy as compared to radiotherapy alone.

After spinal cord injury there are two phases: an initial phase of spinal shock followed by a second phase of increased reflex activity with spasticity. The acute spinal shock phase occurs soon after the injury, and lasts for a few weeks (between 1 and 6, but with no exact limits). It is manifested by suppression of spinal segmental activity below the level of the lesion. With complete spinal cord injury, the patient will have a flaccid weakness with areflexia below the lesion, atonic bladder with overflow incontinence, distention of the bowel with absence of peristalsis and constipation, depressed rectal tone and abolished genital reflexes. There is autonomic dysfunction below the lesion explaining the hypotension seen in these cases. A few weeks after the spinal cord injury, the patient will start presenting features of increased reflexic activity below the lesion. There is no clear chronologic boundary between this stage and the previous one of spinal shock. In this second stage there are upper motor neuron findings with increased tone leading to spasticity and hyperreflexia. Plantar responses are upgoing, triple flexion response commonly occurs. Patients will have detrusor spasms and hyperactivity with urinary loss secondary to spontaneous bladder contraction as well as spontaneous reflex defecation. These bladder and bowel reflexes are probably explained by the lack of inhibition of the sacral neurons by rostral centers, leading to spontaneous contraction secondary to a local reflex arc. Neither spontaneous reflex defecation nor detrusor contraction is present in the spinal shock phase. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP. Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology. 10th ed.

      "explicacao": "muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1. The SMAs are a group of four disorders of anterior horn cell degeneration. SMA type 1, infantile SMA or Werdnig–Hoffman disease presents with decreased fetal movements, neonatal hypotonia, and weak cry. Patients with SMA type 1 exhibit head lag and frog-leg posture when supine, and are never able to sit up or achieve antigravity strength in the arms or legs. Diffuse areflexia is often present. Bulbar involvement leads to dysphagia, and respiratory involvement occurs. Death usually occurs by 2 years of age. In SMA type 2, intermediate SMA, symptoms begin in the first 1 to 2 years of life, with motor delay and tremor in some cases. This form is less severe than SMA1, with most children being able to sit unsupported, but significant contractures develop, and most are not able to ambulate. SMA type 3, juvenile SMA or Kugelberg–Welander disease, typically presents in childhood (between ages 5 and 15 years) with difficult walking. The clinical picture is one of proximal muscle weakness, a fine action tremor, and fasciculations. Patients often remain ambulatory into adulthood. SMA type 4, adult-onset SMA or pseudomyopathic SMA, is the least common and least severe. Symptoms typically begin in the third to fourth decade of life, and include proximal muscle weakness, with the quadriceps being prominently involved, and fasciculations. Ambulation into late adulthood is common. Cranial nerve and respiratory involvement is rare. Commercially available molecular analysis of the SMN gene is available. Serum creatine kinase may be significantly elevated (more than 10 times normal), particularly in the younger-onset forms. Sensory NCSs are normal; EMG shows evidence of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation, with large polyphasic motor units. Complex repetitive discharges occur in SMA type 3. Muscle biopsy shows atrophy of entire fascicles or groups of fascicles, with normal or hypertrophied neighboring fascicles, as depicted in Figure 11.5 . The majority of cases of SMA are due to mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene on chromosome 5. Inheritance is autosomal recessive in most cases, though a minority of cases involving other genes with autosomal dominant or X- 939 linked inheritance have been identified. The gene product, SMN1 protein, is involved in RNA processing. In later-onset forms, some residual functional protein is present, leading to the milder phenotype. As mentioned, spinal muscular atrophy type 4 presents in adulthood. Charcot–Marie–Tooth type 1 typically presents in childhood (rather than the neonatal period), and will not be associated with the muscle biopsy findings shown in Figure 11.5 . Congenital myasthenia and botulism are on the differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonia but would not lead to the muscle biopsy findings shown in Figure 11.5 . Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

      "explicacao": "According to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines, routine dementia screening should include assessment for vitamin B12, complete blood count, electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and depression screening. Further testing including HIV, VDRL, lumbar puncture, and heavy metals are not recommended in routine screening without a specific clinical indication. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Inherited forms of AD are all autosomal dominant and typically present before age 65, although these cases account for less than 5% of all cases of AD. Presenilin-2 in chromosome 1 leads to early- onset familial AD. Presenilin-1 in chromosome 14, accounts for 70% to 80% of early-onset aggressive familial cases of AD. Apolipoprotein E4 is located in chromosome 19 and triples the risk of AD as well as leading to an early age of onset, but does not lead to AD per se (it only modifies the risk of AD). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is located in chromosome 21. Chromosome 2 is not related to AD. In addition, variants in the TREM2 gene appear to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. Injury to any structures within the circuit of Papez will interrupt formation of new memories. The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is not part of the circuit of Papez. The circuit of Papez is: entorhinal cortex → hippocampus → fornix → mammillary bodies → anterior nucleus of thalamus → cingulate gyrus → entorhinal cortex → hippocampus. Memory is conceptually divided into different forms. Immediate memory is the amount of information someone can keep in conscious awareness without active memorization. Immediate memory can be tested by forward digit span. Normal human beings can retain seven digits in active memory span. Working memory is tested by manipulation of information retained in immediate memory (adding two of the digits repeated in a number series, or reciting a series of numbers backward [digits backward]). Recent memory involves the ability to register and recall specific items after a delay of minutes or hours. It requires the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas of the medial temporal lobe for storage and retrieval, which is why it is usually impaired first in early AD and is evident by impaired 981 word recall (three-word recall). Remote memory is tested by asking about historical life events and long-known information. Memory impairment is the essential and earliest clinical feature of AD. Declarative memory (facts and events) is significantly affected in AD. Of declarative memory, episodic memory (specific events and contexts) is the most impaired in early AD. Within episodic memory, memory for recent events is more prominently impaired in early AD compared with immediate or remote memory. Memory for facts such as vocabulary and concepts (semantic memory) is spared until later. Likewise, procedural memory and motor learning are also spared until later. Loss of visuospatial skills is also often an early feature of AD which manifests as navigational difficulty in unfamiliar and later familiar areas and misplacement of items. Other features often associated with later stages of AD include progressive language dysfunction, impaired executive function, lack of insight, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and apraxia. Inability to recognize objects and faces, or visual agnosia and prosopagnosia, respectively (see discussion to question 48) are late features. Ahmed S, Mitchell J, Arnold R, et al.

The patient depicted in question 14 appears to have this phenotype. The second phenotype, progressive nonfluent aphasia, is characterized in early stages by anomia, word-finding difficulty, impaired object naming, and effortful speech with preserved comprehension. Spontaneous speech becomes increasingly dysfluent and speech errors become frequent. Behavior and social interaction remain unaffected until late in the disease at which point the patient becomes globally aphasic. The third phenotype is semantic dementia, also called progressive fluent aphasia, or the temporal variant of FTD. It is characterized by a progressive speech disturbance with normal fluency, but impaired comprehension, anomia, and semantic paraphasias. It may clinically resemble a transcortical sensory aphasia. There is typically a predominance of left temporal dysfunction, and/or in face and object recognition, reflecting right temporal dysfunction. In addition, some patients with FTD may develop variant syndromes of motor impairment including motor neuron disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration.

Delirium is classically differentiated by dementia by its subacute nature (days) and waxing and waning course as opposed to the slow (months to years) steady cognitive impairment seen in dementia. The patient’s age, combined with the stress of major surgery and probable exposure to postoperative pain medications are all contributors to this common occurrence. Infections such as urinary tract infection and pneumonia, as well as hypoxia (such as from pulmonary embolus), are also potential causes of delirium. Assessing his medications to look for contributors (especially narcotics, sedative hypnotics, antihistamines, and anticholinergics) and routine metabolic studies should be checked. An arterial blood gas should be checked if hypoxia is suspected. Visual hallucinations are most often related to metabolic derangements and medications. Although stroke should be ruled out in the appropriate clinical context, it is unlikely in this case based on this constellation of symptoms (especially positive visual hallucinations in the absence of focal findings). Seizures are also unlikely, although occipital lobe seizures can cause colorful geometric hallucinations. In this patient, an EEG would most likely show diffuse slowing, which would be typical of delirium. In this case, his symptoms are unlikely to be related to schizophrenia, as there is no prior history. In addition, hallucinations in schizophrenia are typically auditory, rather than visual. Therefore, there is no need for a psychiatry consult at this time. A lumbar puncture is not indicated given the history presented, though should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.

      "explicacao": "This histopathology is consistent with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). The five human prion diseases are kuru, CJD, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) (“mad cow disease”), Gerstmann–Straüssler–Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). These diseases share the neuropathologic features of neuronal loss, glial cell proliferation, absent inflammatory response, and vacuolization of the neuropil, which produces the characteristic spongiform appearance. Sporadic CJD occurs at a rate of approximately 1 per 1,000,000 population per year. CJD is a rapidly progressive dementia associated with variable extrapyramidal/pyramidal tract signs, myoclonus, and ataxia, and death typically ensues within 1 year. Sporadic cases account for 85% to 95%, while 5% to 15% are familial, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The pathology occurs when the normal prion protein (PrP), which is primarily an α-helical structure, converts into an abnormal form containing a higher percentage of β-pleated sheets. The abnormal form is insoluble, polymerizes, and accumulates intracellularly and is resistant to proteolysis. The prion protein gene (PRNP) coding for PrP is located on chromosome 20p. The other chromosomes listed all relate to Alzheimer’s disease. Polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP is believed to determine susceptibility for CJD, and homozygosity for either methionine or valine at codon 129 has a strong correlation with the various forms of CJD including sporadic, iatrogenic, variant (“mad cow disease”), and familial forms. Neuroimaging of CJD includes cortical ribbon sign (restricted diffusion in the cortex), and increased T2 signal in the caudate, putamen, and pulvinar of the thalamus. Hippocampal lumpy bumpy sign is suggestive of Alzheimer’s pathology. Thinning of the head of the caudate may be seen in Huntington’s disease. Calcification in the basal ganglia occurs in Fahr’s disease and in other disorders of calcium metabolism. Eye of the tiger sign is seen pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN).

Topographagnosia, a defect in spatial orientation, is marked by inability to navigate in familiar places, read maps, draw floor maps of familiar places, and perform similar functions. It localizes to the nondominant posterior parahippocampal region, infracalcarine cortex, or nondominant parietal lobe. Asomatognosia is marked by an indifferent inability to recognize one’s own body part. It most often localizes to the contralateral (usually nondominant) superior parietal lobule, the supramarginal gyrus, and/or its connections. In somatoparaphrenia, a form of asomatognosia, the patient denies ownership of a limb or limbs and claims the limb is missing, or has been stolen. Misoplegia is severe hatred of a limb, a rare form of agnosia seen in hemiparetic or hemiplegic patients following stroke. The patient may attempt to cut off the limb or otherwise damage it.

Anomia usually occurs in association with other features of Broca’s (expressive) aphasia (see question 54), though it may occur in isolation, particularly during recovery of a Broca’s (expressive) aphasia. Anomia may occur with a variety of lesions, including dominant hemisphere posterior inferior frontal gyrus and temporal lesions.

The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is involved in motor initiation, goal-directed behavior, and motivation. Lesions to this area, and bilateral lesions to the anterior cingulate, which commonly result from anterior cerebral artery infarcts and tumors, lead to apathy, indifference, loss of initiative, amotivation, and abulia, or a reduction (or in severe cases abolition) of movement and communication due to involvement of the supplementary motor area, as depicted in question 66. In extensive bilateral lesions to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the most severe form of this nonparalytic akinesia, akinetic mutism, results. Because the paracentral lobule (the mesial projection of the somatosensory cortex) is involved in voluntary urinary continence, lesions to this area often are associated with urinary incontinence. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the planning of motor activity and behavior, executive functioning, judgment, and problem solving. Lesions to this area lead to impaired judgment, impaired ability to plan, multitask, and problem solve, and anhedonia, or a lack of interest in previously pleasurable activities, as depicted in question 67.

The Trail Making Test Part A times the patient as he/she connects numbers on a page, and is a test of simple speed of processing, visual search, and attention. The Trail Making Test Part B requires the patient to connect consecutive numbers and letters, and tests set shifting (shifting between numbers and letters) and working memory (maintaining the correct sequence), in addition to the demands of Trails A. The Random Cancellation Test, a measure of visual attention and processing speed, assesses the ability to visually scan and identify specific targets in a large array of similar items. In the Clock-Drawing Test, a test of visuospatial function but also auditory comprehension, attention, and executive function, the patient is asked to draw a clock (including the numbers) with the hands set at a specific time.

In illness anxiety disorder (which encompasses a disorder previously known as hypochondriasis), there is chronic and pervasive preoccupation with physical symptoms and fear of having a serious disease, often resulting from misinterpretation of physical symptoms, even after diagnostic testing and exclusion of the condition of concern or any other identifiable medical condition. As with the patient in question 22, patients with body dysmorphic disorder experience a chronic and intense preoccupation with a perceived defect of appearance or over- concern with minor physical abnormalities. Such patients often seek unnecessary and repeated surgical procedures to correct their perceived deformity. Somatic symptom disorder and related conditions are more frequent in women. Patients with these disorders often have a history of physical and/or emotional abuse and neglect. They frequently have comorbid psychiatric disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and substance abuse. For example, one-third of patients with conversion disorder suffer from a mood or anxiety disorder, and half from a personality disorder. The key point distinguishing somatic symptom disorder and related conditions from factitious disorder is that in the former, symptoms are not intentionally feigned, whereas with factitious disorder, symptoms are voluntarily feigned for secondary gain. Factitious disorder is discussed further in question 44. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2013.

It is the limbic and cortical–subcortical pathways (mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways) that are thought to be overactive in psychosis, rather than the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways. There are five dopamine receptors identified, D 1 to D 5 . It is mainly the D 2 receptor that is implicated in the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Support for the dopamine hypothesis comes from evidence that there is increased dopamine receptor density in the brains of schizophrenics postmortem and increased D 2 receptor occupancy in the brains of schizophrenics on functional imaging. Improvement of psychosis with D 2 antagonism and worsening of psychosis with dopaminergic agonists such as levodopa, amphetamines, and dopamine agonists further lend support to this theory. However, the dopamine hypothesis only partially explains the many features of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. For example, reduced dopaminergic activity in specific cortical areas including the medial temporal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the hippocampus is thought to underlie the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates a role for excessive serotonergic activity, particularly at serotonergic 5-HT 2A receptors, in the pathogenesis of hallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis. The occurrence of hallucinations with exposure to lysergic acid diethylamide (discussed in Chapter 17 ), a serotonin agonist, lends support to this theory, as does the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics, which have serotonergic antagonism in addition to antidopaminergic activity. Underactivity of glutamate pathways, which normally excite inhibitory GABA pathways, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, as evidenced by the ability of phencyclidine and ketamine (noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, discussed in Chapter 17 ) to exacerbate cognitive dysfunction and psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.

Menstruation remains regular. The binge eating form of eating disorder not otherwise specified is the most common eating disorder, followed by bulimia and anorexia nervosa. Peak onset of eating disorders is in the teenage years, though they may begin at any age. Eating disorders are more common in females than in males, with a 3:1 ratio, though males are likely underdiagnosed.

Schizoid personality disorder is more common in males, and may appear as an antecedent to delusional disorder (discussed in question 31) or schizophrenia (discussed in questions 24 and 25). Schizotypal personality disorder, depicted in question 43, is marked by odd, peculiar, and eccentric ideas, beliefs, and/or behaviors including magical thinking (such as superstitiousness or belief in clairvoyance or telepathy), paranoid ideation, and constricted affect. Individuals with this personality disorder have social anxiety and are uncomfortable with close relationships; they typically lack close friends outside of immediate family members.

      "explicacao": "by hypersensitivity to criticism, feelings of inadequacy, and social inhibition. Individuals with this disorder may avoid an occupation or other activity that will involve contact with others because of fear of criticism or rejection. They may show restraint in personal relationships because of fear of being ridiculed, and are willing to get involved with people only if certain of being liked. They often view themselves as socially inept and inferior to others. Unlike persons with schizoid personality disorder (depicted in question 42), those with avoidant personality disorder want relationships but avoid them because of fear of criticism, whereas those with schizoid personality disorder prefer social isolation. Avoidant personality disorder shares features with panic disorder with agoraphobia (discussed in questions 7 and 8) but in the latter condition, avoidance is of specific social situations that lead to panic attacks. Avoidant personality disorder begins at an early age, without clear precipitants, and is stable over time. Social phobia (discussed in questions 13 and 14) and avoidant personality disorder may co-occur. Individuals with dependent personality disorder, depicted in question 47 have a chronic and excessive need to be taken care of. They may be clingy and have fear of separation. They have difficulty making day-to-day decisions without advice and reassurance from others, and prefer for others to assume responsibility for major areas of life. They are submissive and avoid disagreement with others for fear of loss of approval. They lack self-confidence and consequently avoid initiating projects or doing things independently. Individuals with this disorder may feel helpless when alone because of fear of being unable to care of themselves, and may urgently seek a new relationship as a source of care if another relationship ends. Dependent personality disorder is equally common in males and females, and is one of the most common personality disorders. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, depicted in question 48, is marked by a dysfunctional and unproductive preoccupation with orderliness, perfection, and control at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. Individuals with this disorder are perfectionists without this necessarily being productive. They are rigid and inflexible in various aspects of life including in work and 1092 in relationships. They often prioritize work at the expense of leisure activities or friendship. Some individuals with this personality disorder have difficulty parting with unneeded objects (to the extent of hoarding in some cases). Although obsessive- compulsive disorder (discussed in question 17) may coexist with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, distinct and definable obsessions and compulsions are absent in the latter, distinguishing the two. Patients with personality disorders lack insight into their pathology, but may be asked to seek care from a psychiatrist by family members or others in the setting of dysfunction in relationships, occupation, or otherwise.

In some patients, a combination of these occurs. Although the etiology of ADHD is not clear, dysfunction in frontal-subcortical circuits has been implicated. Genetic studies have suggested involvement of genes related to dopamine action or metabolism, though environmental factors play a role as well. Children of parents with ADHD and siblings of children with ADHD are more likely to be affected with ADHD than the general population. Oppositional defiant disorder (discussed in question 28) is a distinct entity from ADHD, but the two are often comorbid. Similarly, generalized anxiety disorder (discussed in question 18), is also comorbid with ADHD, as are the disruptive behavior disorders (discussed in questions 27 and 28). Tic disorder also frequently occurs with ADHD. In childhood, academic failure and peer rejection are the major consequences of ADHD, whereas in adolescence there is a threefold increase in substance use and abuse. Approximately 60% of patients with ADHD in childhood continue to be impaired in adult life; ADHD may also not be recognized until adulthood. Adults with ADHD typically show instability with employment and relationships. The first line of treatment for ADHD are psychostimulants including amphetamines and methylphenidates, of which there are various oral preparations. Common side effects include reduced appetite, weight loss, insomnia, and headaches. An electrocardiogram prior to initiation of stimulant medications is recommended to exclude underlying structural or conduction problems. Other medications used to treat ADHD include the nonstimulant atomoxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and the α 2 -agonist clonidine. Psychosocial treatment is also an important part of managing ADHD. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2013.

The typical antipsychotics, first brought into clinical use in the 1950s, include chlorpromazine and thioridazine, which have low potency at D 2 (dopamine) receptors and higher antagonism at muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors. They are therefore more likely to cause side effects related to antagonism at these receptors, such as dry mouth, orthostasis, and sedation, respectively. Those with higher potency at D 2 receptors, such as haloperidol and fluphenazine, have activity at muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors as well and can lead to similar side effects, but are less likely to do so. On the other hand, they are more likely to lead to extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), which result from D 2 - antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway. The EPS can be divided into acute reactions such as acute dystonia, which are in general reversible with treatment with antimuscarinic agents such as benztropine, and tardive dyskinesia (such as the orolingual dyskinesias depicted in question 55, or tardive cervical dystonia), which are in general irreversible but may be treatable with botulinum toxin or deep brain stimulation to the globus pallidus interna (see Chapter 6 ). Many of the typical antipsychotic agents can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly, making them convenient in the treatment of psychotic patients for whom oral administration is difficult. Prochlorperazine is an antidopaminergic agent used predominantly in the treatment of nausea. Brunton LL, Blumenthal DK, Murri N, et al, eds.

Other adverse effects include memory disturbance, sedation, and respiratory depression in overdose (or even at therapeutic doses in those with pulmonary disease). Chronic therapy for anxiety disorders therefore includes medications such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The latter medications do not have acute effects on anxiety, and in the initial weeks of therapy, benzodiazepines are often used as adjuncts until the anxiolysis takes effect. Of the benzodiazepines, flurazepam and clorazepate have the longest half- lives. Triazolam has a rapid onset and short duration of action. Besides the treatment of acute anxiety, benzodiazepines are also used in the treatment of seizures, alcohol withdrawal, spasticity and movement disorders, and insomnia. Several benzodiazepines are available in various oral, sublingual, intravenous, and intramuscular formulations (including but not limited to midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam), making them useful in the treatment of emergencies such as status epilepticus, as well as in anesthesia.

      "explicacao": "disorders may co-occur in the same individual. questions 64 to 67 depict people that would be classified under cluster B of the personality disorders. This cluster includes narcissistic, antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders. Narcissistic personality disorder, depicted in question 64, is marked by grandiosity and a sense of self-importance. These individuals are arrogant and preoccupied by perceived positive attributes such as success or beauty, believe that they are superior to others, and have a sense of self-entitlement. On the other hand they have fears of others seeing their flaws. They manipulate others to achieve ends in their own self-interest, often at the expense of the interest of others. Individuals with this disorder also lack empathy. Narcissistic personality disorder is more common in males, and major depression (discussed in questions 1 and 2) and substance abuse are common comorbidities. Antisocial personality disorder, depicted in question 65, is marked by disrespect of others and the law, starting since age 15. Individuals with this disorder exhibit deceptiveness, impulsivity, aggressiveness, recklessness, and irresponsibility (in the workplace, financially, etc.). They lack remorse, with indifference to harming others. Conduct disorder (discussed in question 27) is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder; antisocial personality disorder cannot be diagnosed in those younger than 18. Impulse control disorder (discussed in questions 35 and 36) may occur in persons with antisocial personality disorder, but the other features of antisocial personality disorder discussed distinguish the two. Antisocial personality disorder is three times more common in males as compared to females. Borderline personality disorder, depicted in question 66, is marked by pervasive instability in various aspects including self- image, relationships, and affect. In their interactions with and perception of others, individuals with this disorder alternate between idealization and devaluation (so-called splitting ). They have an intense fear of abandonment and go to extremes to avoid this. They often engage in self-injurious behavior including suicidal gesture or threats, or self-mutilation. The instability and extremism extends to eating behaviors and sexuality. Borderline personality 1104 disorder is more common in females. Frequent comorbidities include major depression, eating disorder (particularly bulimia; discussed in question 37–38), and substance abuse. Histrionic personality disorder, depicted in question 67, is marked by attention-seeking behavior, including constant need to be the center of attention and inappropriately seductive or provocative behavior. Individuals with this disorder use their physical appearance to draw attention to themselves, and may be theatrical and dramatic. They also exhibit excessive emotionality and have shallow and rapidly shifting emotions. Histrionic personality disorder is more common in females, and common comorbidities include major depression, conversion disorder, and somatic symptom disorder. Patients with personality disorders lack insight into their pathology, but may be asked to seek care from a psychiatrist by family members or others in the setting of dysfunction in relationships, occupation, or otherwise. Treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy combined with pharmacotherapy aimed at the most prominent psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiolytics if anxiety is the main symptom, or mood stabilizers or antipsychotics if lability, aggression, and impulsivity are the most prominent symptoms).

Mirtazapine has complex pharmacology; it acts as an antagonist at presynaptic α 2 -receptors, increasing release of norepinephrine and serotonin, and also acts as an antagonist at 5-HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors. Its potent antagonism at histamine receptors accounts for its sedating effects. The mechanism of action of bupropion is not well understood, but animal studies have shown that it inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and increases presynaptic release of these neurotransmitters, without direct effects on the serotonin system. At high doses, bupropion increases risk of seizures. Bupropion, in addition to its use as an antidepressant, is used in smoking cessation. Trazodone and nefazodone act primarily by antagonism at the 5- HT 2 receptor; trazodone was initially used as an antidepressant, but its primary use today is as a hypnotic (sedative) because it is highly sedating and little tolerance develops to its sedating effect over time. An adverse effect that may occur with trazodone therapy is priapism or prolonged painful erection. Phenelzine and isocarboxazid are nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and are among the oldest antidepressants, rarely used in clinical practice today due to their side effect profile. Because nonselective MAOIs block metabolism of tyramine, found in certain foods such as cheese and wine, a lethal reaction resulting from hyperadrenergic state can occur with use of MAOIs, particularly when taken with other agents that increase serotonin.

Electroconvulsive therapy (discussed in question 80) can be effective after 8 to 12 sessions, but is often reserved for medication-resistant depression because of cognitive side effects. Clear superiority of one antidepressant over another has not been demonstrated in meta-analyses, and choice of antidepressant may depend more on side effect profile, risk of drug–drug interactions, cost, and other such factors unrelated to efficacy. For example, in the patient presented in question 71, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor may be undesirable because of the risk of erectile dysfunction; alternative antidepressants with less risk of sexual side effects include bupropion and venlafaxine. A sedating agent such as a tricyclic antidepressant or mirtazapine may help with his poor sleep. Venlafaxine can cause a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure, and may be best avoided in a patient with known hypertension. Less than 50% of patients respond to the initial antidepressant selected, and augmentation with another agent or discontinuation with switching to an agent from another class is often necessary. Several algorithms have been developed to aid physicians in selection of the most appropriate antidepressant. The duration of therapy depends on the patient’s psychiatric history, response to treatment, and relapse rate. More than 80% of patients with an episode of major depression have at least one recurrence during their lifetime, and sometimes long-term and even life-long maintenance therapy with an antidepressant is required.

In TMS, a rapidly changing magnetic field is applied to the scalp and is thought to affect the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, locally inducing small electric currents. Single-pulse TMS is generally considered safe but seizures are nevertheless a potential risk, even in individuals without a prior history of epilepsy. Application of TMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improves symptoms in major depression. In VNS, intermittent electrical stimulation is directly applied via an electrode to the left cervical vagus nerve. The current is provided by a pulse generator, a pacemaker-sized device that is implanted in the chest and is connected to the electrode. Stimulation of the afferent vagus nerve fibers leads to changes in several brainstem nuclei that are involved in the pathophysiology of depression, such as the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and raphe nuclei, leading to alterations in serotonergic activity in cortical and limbic structures. VNS is used as adjunctive therapy for chronic or recurrent depression in individuals with either unipolar depression or bipolar disorder. Sadock BJ, Sadock VA, Ruiz P, eds.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "the neural plate undergoes fusion to form the neural tube in different areas at different times, and failure to fuse at each site results in specific defects. Abnormal rostral fusion at the anterior neuropore leads to abnormalities such as encephalocele or anencephaly, whereas abnormal caudal fusion (at the posterior neuropore) leads to disorders such as spina bifida. Following neurulation, the neural tube undergoes segmentation into three vesicles, in a process called specification, whereby different segments begin to acquire cell types and characteristics specific to the central nervous system (CNS) structure that will eventually arise from them (malformations resulting from defects in this stage of development are further discussed in questions 8, 11, 16, and 19). The three segments include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon subsequently forms the telencephalon, which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres, as well as the diencephalon, which forms the hypothalamus and the thalamus. The mesencephalon gives rise to the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon gives rise to the rest of the brainstem (pons and medulla) and the cerebellum. Abnormalities during specification, which occurs at 5 to 6 weeks of gestation, lead to disorders such as septo-optic dysplasia (discussed in question 30). As the nervous system becomes more organized and specific areas more specialized, neuronal migration begins along specific routes, and abnormalities of neuronal proliferation and migration in turn lead to specific developmental abnormalities (discussed in questions 36, 38, 44, 45 and 53). The peripheral nervous system (including the autonomic ganglia) forms from neural crest cells that are derived from the neural tube after it fuses. In addition to peripheral nervous system structures, neural crest cells give rise to the chromaffin tissue of the adrenal medulla and melanocytes. Swaiman KF, Ashwal S, Ferriero DM, et al.

Despite treatment, some patients still have varying degrees of mild–moderate cognitive delays. Acute metabolic encephalopathy, common to inborn errors of metabolism, does not typically occur in patients with PKU. Newborn screening detects hyperphenylalaninemia, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of elevation of phenylalanine levels in blood. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, and its deficiency may produce hyperphenylalaninemia (and PKU). A reduction of phenylalanine levels in blood and urine after a trial of tetrahydrobiopterin is used to make the diagnosis of this condition. The treatment of PKU is dietary restriction of phenylalanine, and these patients should be placed on a low-protein diet and phenylalanine-free feeding formula as soon as possible after birth, which will prevent neurologic deterioration. Tetrahydrobiopterin is used as a treatment adjunct in select patients. Piña-Garza JE. Fenichel’s Clinical Pediatric Neurology: A Signs and Symptoms Approach. 7th ed. London: Saunders Elsevier; 2013."

At around 1 week, these patients may have coma and respiratory failure, with subsequent cerebral edema and seizures, and eventually death if untreated. The intermediate form presents in late infancy with developmental delay, failure to thrive, ataxia, and seizures. There may be exacerbations with protein intake or intercurrent infections. Some cases are responsive to thiamine. In the intermittent form, patients are normal in between episodes, and alteration of consciousness and ataxia occur during intercurrent illness or in the presence of other stressors. These patients typically have urine with a maple syrup odor, which is more prominent during exacerbations. Diagnosis is made by detection of elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids and their ketoacids in blood and urine. Enzyme activity can be measured in fibroblasts and hepatocytes. Treatment is a low-protein diet, more specifically a branched- chain amino acid–restricted diet, which should be started early in life (as soon as the diagnosis is suspected) to prevent cognitive decline. Thiamine should be provided, since some patients may be responsive to this vitamin. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be a therapy for these patients. This condition is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment in most patients with the classic or severe form of the disease. Piña-Garza JE.

      "explicacao": "defect within the vertebral column. This protrusion is typically covered by skin. It is not usually associated with neurologic deficits, and if neurologic deficit is found, myelomeningocele should be suspected. Myelomeningocele (also known as spinal dysraphism or rachischisis) is protrusion of potentially all layers of intraspinal contents through a bony defect: spinal cord, nerve roots, and meninges. The spinal cord may either be exposed, or a thin membrane may cover the protrusion. They most often occur in the lumbosacral region but can occur at any level. This is a clinically severe NTD associated with hydrocephalus, motor and sensory abnormalities of the legs, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Myelomeningocele occurs in association with Chiari II malformations (discussed in question 21). Diastematomyelia is splitting of the spinal cord into two portions by a midline septum. Diplomyelia is duplication of the spinal cord and is distinguished from diastematomyelia by the presence of two central canals each surrounded by gray and white matter as in a normal spinal cord. Sacral agenesis, or absence of the whole (or in some cases parts of the) sacrum, classically occurs in association with a variety of other urogenital, gastrointestinal, and spinal cord abnormalities. It has been associated with maternal insulin-dependent diabetes. Autosomal dominant forms associated with homeobox gene mutations have been identified. Clinical manifestations range from mild motor deficits to severe sensory and motor deficits and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Management of NTDs involves surgical approaches as well as management of complications including hydrocephalus and bowel and bladder dysfunction. A search for associated malformations in other organs (such as the heart or kidneys) should be pursued. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is encoded by the gene HPRT1 on chromosome Xq26, and deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of purines with their subsequent conversion to uric acid. There is a spectrum of the disease, ranging from the classic Lesch–Nyhan syndrome to milder forms without neurologic manifestations. The classic form may manifest in the newborn period with severe hypotonia. These children will have delayed motor development, progressive limb and neck rigidity with dystonia, choreoathetotic movements, facial grimacing, seizures, spasticity, and intellectual impairment. Aggressive behavior, self- mutilation, and progressive dementia are hallmarks of the neurologic form of the disease. Milder forms include those with less severe neurologic disease, and those in whom there are no neurologic manifestations and presenting with hyperuricemia, gout, and nephrolithiasis. The clinical picture, including neurologic manifestations, self- mutilation behavior, and hyperuricemia, suggests the diagnosis. Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity can be assessed in fibroblasts, and genetic testing can also be used. Treatment includes purine-restricted diet, hydration to prevent kidney stones, allopurinol to decrease the production of uric acid, and supportive care to prevent self-inflicted injuries and control of abnormal movements.

      "explicacao": "cerebral hemispheres are almost completely fused, with absence of the interhemispheric fissure and corpus callosum. There is a single midline ventricle. Variable dysgenesis and fusion of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and basal ganglia is present. In semilobar holoprosencephaly, parts of the posterior hemispheres may be separated by a fissure. In lobar holoprosencephaly, only the most anterior portions of the hemispheres are not separated, and there is partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, but the splenium and genu are present. The olfactory bulb and tracts develop from the prosencephalon a few days after the hemispheres divide. In severe forms of holoprosencephaly, arrhinencephaly (agenesis of the olfactory bulb and tract) invariably occurs. However, in less severe forms of holoprosencephaly, arrhinencephaly may occur in isolation. Kallmann’s syndrome, an X-linked dominant disorder, is characterized by anosmia (due to arrhinencephaly) and hypogonadism. In infants with alobar holoprosencephaly, associated midline facial defects such as cyclopia (single midline eye) and proboscis (single-nostril nose) often occur, and these more severely affected individuals are usually stillborn or do not survive long after birth. If death does not occur in utero, the clinical picture includes severe cognitive and motor delay, feeding difficulties, and seizures. Endocrinologic problems including diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism are frequent. Hydrocephalus is a frequent complication. In less severe forms such as in isolated arrhinencephaly, little neurologic dysfunction may be clinically apparent. Chromosomal aberrations associated with holoprosencephaly include trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. Autosomal recessive and dominant forms, due to mutations in the sonic hedgehog gene and other genes, exist. In addition to a variety of genetic and environmental mechanisms, the pathophysiology of holoprosencephaly also relates to abnormal cholesterol metabolism, as cholesterol influences sonic hedgehog protein function. Hence, holoprosencephaly has an association with the cholesterol synthesis disorder Smith-Lemli-Opitz, which results from a defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the enzyme that 1192 catalyzes the final step in cholesterol synthesis.

Neurologic manifestations involve both the peripheral nervous system (including small fiber neuropathy with attacks of cold-induced painful paresthesias in the extremities, acroparesthesias) and the CNS. Central nervous system manifestations include stroke and other vascular events related to vascular ectasia, with often marked dolichoectatic enlargement of the basilar artery. Fabry’s disease is also discussed in question 24. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder in which telangiectasia occurs in the skin, mucous membranes, and several organs including the retina and the gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent epistaxis is a common manifestation. Central nervous system involvement results from single or multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or cerebral embolism associated with pulmonary AVMs. It results from a mutation in the HHT1 gene on chromosome 9 that encodes for endoglin, a protein that binds transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), or from a mutation in the HHT2 gene on chromosome 12. Wyburn–Mason syndrome is another neurocutaneous disorder in which multiple AVMs occur on the face, in the retina, and intracranially. In pseudoxanthoma elasticum (Gronblad–Strandberg syndrome), a connective tissue disorder that may be autosomal dominant or recessive, yellowish xanthomas occur in various skin regions and mucous membranes. Pigmentary changes in the retina result in a peu d’orange (orange skin) appearance and angioid streaks develop, which do not affect the vision directly, but due to weakening of retinal vessels, hemorrhages may occur. Neurologic manifestations relate to vascular occlusions and intracranial carotid artery aneurysms. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome exists in at least 10 subtypes, with types I, II, and III being the most common. These subtypes share the occurrence of hyperelastic skin, hyperextensible joints, and vascular lesions. This syndrome results from mutations in various genes encoding for different types of collagen. The main neurologic significance of this disorder is the increased risk of intracranial aneurysms, carotid-cavernous fistulas (that may be spontaneous or due to mild trauma), and arterial dissection. 1197 Xeroderma pigmentosum is a neurocutaneous disorder marked by sensitivity to ultraviolet light that predisposes affected individuals to skin freckling and multiple cutaneous malignancies including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma as well as other cutaneous and systemic tumors. Neurologic abnormalities include progressive cognitive dysfunction, hearing loss, tremor, chorea, and ataxia as well as peripheral neuropathy. Xeroderma pigmentosum is autosomal recessive associated with mutations on chromosome 9 that result in abnormal DNA repair. Cockayne’s syndrome is a related disorder. Another disorder of DNA repair associated with neurologic features is ataxia telangiectasia (discussed in Chapter 6 ). Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Brain abnormalities may be seen in some of these patients and a subset develop cognitive impairment. Although less frequent than with the childhood onset cerebral type, adrenal insufficiency also occurs and adrenal function should be monitored. Pathologically, there is long tract degeneration with axon and myelin loss. Peripheral nerve demyelination without inflammation also occurs. The third type is isolated adrenal insufficiency. Rarely, patients with adrenoleukodystrophy may present with Addisonian crisis. Patients with adrenoleukodystrophy have increased plasma levels of very long-chain fatty acids, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is increased secondary to adrenal insufficiency.

Lipodystrophy with prominent fat pads in the buttocks and suprapubic area, as well as inverted nipples, is distinctive. Type II CDGs are caused by abnormal processing and modification of glycans and lead to profound intellectual impairment but no cerebellar ataxia or peripheral neuropathy.

Studies have found that ventricular zone radial glia cells are primitive pluripotential cells that can initially divide and generate radial glia cells and immature neurons, which would eventually migrate along the radial glia to the cortical plate. Neuronal progenitor cells (immature progenitor cells and nonepithelial radial glia-like cells) are found in the ventricular and subventricular zones, which can divide and produce immature neurons. Several factors influence neurogenesis (formation of neurons, including pyramidal neurons, cortical granular or stellate neurons, Betz cells, and others) and gliogenesis (formation of glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependyma, and microglia), as well as cell migration. These include regulatory proteins, transcription factors, and neurotransmitters, each varying with the stage of development. Cajal–Retzius cells are a group of pioneer neurons found in the marginal zone.

In incontinentia pigmenti, skin involvement occurs in stages including vesiculobullous lesions present at birth, verrucous lesions that appear at approximately 6 weeks of age, and then hyperpigmented lesions that follow the Blaschko lines (lines of skin development). Hyperpigmentation decreases over time, with tendency to disappear or become hypopigmented and atretic later in life. Some patients have normal cognition and no evidence of neurologic dysfunction; neurologic manifestations include intellectual impairment, pyramidal tract findings, and ocular abnormalities. It is X-linked dominant in inheritance and affects only females; it is thought to be lethal in males. It results from a mutation in the NEMO gene, which encodes a protein involved in the nuclear factor κ B pathway. Neurocutaneous melanosis is characterized by the presence of various types of congenital cutaneous lesions that are abnormally pigmented (such as giant hair pigmented nevi and congenital melanocytic nevi) in association with leptomeningeal melanosis. The leptomeningeal areas most often affected include those around the base of the brain, brainstem, and cerebellum. Hydrocephalus is a common complication. The pathophysiology of this disorder is not well defined; the cells of origin of the leptomeningeal melanosis are thought to be melanoblasts, pigmented cells normally found in the pia mater. There is high risk of developing a melanoma. Parry–Romberg syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of facial tissue, cartilage, and bone, leading to hemifacial atrophy, often with ipsilateral loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair. This begins typically in early childhood and the atrophy progression ceases by the third decade of life. Neurologic manifestations include headaches, Horner’s syndrome, seizures, and hemiparesis. Patients with Parry–Romberg syndrome are at increased risk of a variety of benign tumors. The disorder must be distinguished from scleroderma and lipodystrophy. In Maffucci’s syndrome, multiple enchondromas (tumors of cartilage) occur in association with secondary hemangioma 1206 formation and various skin findings, including vitiligo, hyperpigmented patches and nevi, and café-au-lait spots. These enchondromas grow over time, leading to disfigurement and skeletal abnormalities. Twenty to thirty percent of enchondromas may develop sarcomatous changes. Neurologic manifestations result from the association of this syndrome with various CNS tumors, including pituitary and brainstem tumors and other gliomas. Compression of nervous system structures by the enchondromas, such as cerebral compression by calvarial enchondromas, may also occur. In Von Hippel–Lindau disease, multiple retinal, cerebellar, and spinal hemangioblastomas occur. Benign hemangiomas and cysts in various body parts can also occur. Renal cell carcinoma causes significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Cutaneous manifestations are not a feature of this disorder. This disorder is autosomal dominant and results from a mutation in a gene ( VHL ) on chromosome 3 that encodes for a tumor suppressor protein. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Focal cortical dysplasia includes a wide variety of cortical malformations in which there are abnormal cells (dysmorphic, enlarged neurons, balloon cells) and abnormal lamination. Focal cortical dysplasia may be seen in isolation or in the setting of tuberous sclerosis. One type of focal cortical dysplasia is characterized pathologically by the presence of balloon cells, which result from proliferation of abnormal cells within the germinal matrix. This is a common pathology in focal epilepsy, with seizures often being intractable to medical therapy. Swaiman KF, Ashwal S, Ferriero DM, et al.

      "explicacao": "gyri. It is characterized by the presence of reduced cortical gyration and, in the most severe form, no gyri, or agyria, resulting in a smooth brain. In classic lissencephaly, the cortex is thick but consists of only four layers (or less, often two or three layers, as opposed to the normal six neocortical layers). Formerly, lissencephaly was classified in two groups, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 included MDS and but applied also for other variants. Type 2 consisted of the cobblestone lissencephalies (discussed in question 49). A newer classification groups lissencephalies into lissencephaly variants 4,3,2 layers (according to the number of layers, in which MDS or classic lissencephaly is included as a four-layer variant), cobblestone cortical malformation (discussed in question 49), microlissencephaly spectrum, and other lissencephalies. Miller–Dieker syndrome (four-layer variant, formerly a lissencephaly type 1) is characterized by lissencephaly associated with microcephaly, typical facies including micrognathia (small jaw), low-set ears, thin upper lip, short nose with upturned nares, prominent forehead, bitemporal hollowing, and other features. Clinical manifestations include global developmental delay, hypotonia and later spasticity, and intractable seizures. Life expectancy is often short. Miller–Dieker syndrome has been associated with microdeletions on chromosome 17 in the LIS1 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in regulation of microtubules and dynein function, and mutations interfere with microtubule- directed migration of neurons from the ventricular zone. Mutations in LIS1 gene can also lead to isolated lissencephaly (so-called isolated lissencephaly sequence, without other features of MDS). X-linked lissencephaly results from mutations in the DCX gene on chromosome X when occurring in males. This gene encodes for the protein doublecortin, which is involved in microtubule organization and stabilization. X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia in male patients is attributed to ARX gene mutation. This gene encodes for a transcription factor involved in nonradial migration of cortical interneurons, and patients with lissencephaly secondary to ARX mutation may have abnormalities in the basal ganglia in addition 1210 to the cortex and corpus callosum. In some forms of lissencephaly, there may be an anterior to posterior (or vice versa) gradient of gyral formation (e.g., with some gyral formation in the anterior or posterior aspects of the brain). Several associated malformations may be seen in patients with lissencephalies, including agenesis of the corpus callosum or hypoplasia of the cerebellum. Cobblestone cortical malformation (formerly known as lissencephaly type 2) is seen in several disorders including Walker– Warburg syndrome, Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, and muscle– eye–brain disease of Santavuori (discussed in question 49). In polymicrogyria, there are excess, abnormal gyri (discussed in question 56). Subcortical band heterotopia is discussed in questions 44 and 45. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

This disorder results from a mutation in the DCX gene on chromosome X in females. DCX encodes for the protein doublecortin, which is involved in microtubule organization and stabilization. The same mutation can lead to classic lissencephaly (smooth brain, agyria, or pachygyria) when occurring in males. This difference in manifestations in females as compared with males is thought to result from lyonization (random X inactivation) in females (XX), such that normal migration cannot occur in neurons in which the mutated gene is not compensated by the normal homologous copy, and neurons with normal copy of the gene can migrate to the cortex, resulting in a double cortical band. Subcortical band heterotopia can also occur in some patients with mosaic mutations of LIS1. Clinical features in patients with subcortical band heterotopia include intractable seizures, intellectual impairment and other neurologic deficits. Miller–Dieker syndrome is discussed in questions 41 and 42; it is characterized by agyria or pachygyria rather than the presence of two bands of gray matter separated by a band of white matter.

Walker–Warburg is the most severe form, with smooth cerebral cortex and malformations of brainstem and cerebellum. Muscle– eye–brain disease has intermediate severity in terms of the cobblestone appearance of the cortex, more severe in the frontal regions. Eye abnormalities in Walker–Warburg and muscle–eye– brain disease include retinal hypoplasia, optic nerve atrophy, glaucoma, and cataracts. Muscle–eye–brain disease is seen most commonly in Finland but also occurs in other European populations. Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, which results from a mutation in the gene FKTN encoding for fukutin, is most common in Japan and is rare in other populations. It has the least amount of cortical abnormalities, but the muscular dystrophy is severe with progressive weakness and joint contractures. An elevated level of serum creatine kinase may be seen. Cobblestone malformations associated with muscle involvement have reduced glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. The genes involved in these conditions normally regulate glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. Collectively they may be referred to as congenital muscular dystrophies, or alpha-dystroglycanopathies, and are caused by gene mutations (from most severe to least severe) in POMT1, POMT2, LARGE, FKTN, FKRP, and POMGNT1, though there is poor genotype/phenotype correlation.

Higher levels of ammonia may be associated with coma and eventually death. Females with OTC deficiency, and some males with partial deficiencies, may have late-onset presentations and become symptomatic after large amounts of protein ingestion or intercurrent illnesses. Arginase deficiency does not cause symptoms in the newborn, whereas newborn presentation is common in the rest of urea cycle disorders. Treatment includes limitation of nitrogen intake in the diet and administration of essential amino acids. Calories can be supplied with carbohydrates and fat. During acute episodes, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetic acid are used, and sometimes dialysis may be required. Mannitol has been used for brain edema and increased intracranial pressure. Long-term treatment with low- protein diet and essential amino acids, as well as arginine supplementation (except in arginase deficiency), may stabilize the neurologic deterioration. Piña-Garza JE.

      "explicacao": "been identified in association with polymicrogyria; however, nongenetic causes have also been reported, including hypoxia, hypoperfusion, and congenital infections (mainly cytomegalovirus). Polymicrogyria has also been associated with metabolic disorders such Zellweger’s syndrome (discussed in question 28). Clinical manifestations depend on the location and the extent of the abnormality; epilepsy and developmental delay are common. Schizencephaly, or cleft brain, most often occurs in the perisylvian region but can occur in other regions and can be unilateral or bilateral. In closed-lip schizencephaly, the cerebral cortical walls on either side of the cleft are in contact. In open-lip schizencephaly, the two walls are separated by CSF. Schizencephaly may be an isolated finding or associated with polymicrogyria and other abnormalities, with absent septum pellucidum being a frequent finding. Schizencephaly may be associated with septo-optic dysplasia (see question 30). The etiology of schizencephaly is not completely clear. Nongenetic causes include congenital infections and in utero hypoxic insult, whereas schizencephaly may be associated with mutations of the homeobox gene EMX2. Porencephaly is distinguished from schizencephaly in that the cleft of schizencephaly is lined uniformly with gray matter. Porencephalic cysts are not due to malformations of cortical development but are rather CSF-filled cysts that most often result from in utero infarction or other insult. Porencephalic cysts are lined by white matter or gliosis. Prayson RA. Neuropathology: A Volume in the Series: Foundations in Diagnostic Pathology. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012.

      "explicacao": "Schwannomas and ependymomas rarely occur in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1); they more commonly occur in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Thickening of the left optic nerve as seen in Figure 14.10 likely represents an optic nerve glioma. Optic nerve gliomas are the most common tumor of the CNS seen in patients with NF1 and may be unilateral or bilateral. These are often low-grade lesions but may cause symptoms due to mass effect, including diplopia, pain, and proptosis. Optic pathway gliomas can occur anywhere along the optic pathways, from the optic nerve to the optic radiations. Optic chiasm gliomas may present with precocious puberty when they lead to pressure on diencephalic structures. Because these lesions are often benign, serial imaging over time is often used to monitor these tumors, with chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery instituted as necessary. On MRI, nonspecific subcortical T2 hyperintensities (in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and other regions) are common in patients with NF1 and are of unclear etiology and significance; these may be hamartomatous or dysmyelinating and are referred to commonly by their appearance as “unidentified bright objects” or UBOs. While potentially difficult to appreciate on a single image, Figure 14.10 also shows enlargement of the pons, which possibly represents a low-grade glioma. As mentioned, schwannomas and ependymomas can occur in NF1, but these are rare; they more commonly occur in NF2. Patients with NF1 are at an increased risk of cerebral, cerebellar, and brainstem astrocytomas. Since the NF1 gene functions as a tumor suppressor, patients with NF1 are also at an increased risk for leukemia and other malignancies. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "(ASD). Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by the presence of impaired social interaction and social communication skills and restricted and/or repetitive repertoire of activities, interests, and behavior patterns. The symptoms begin in early developmental stages and limit daily function, causing impairment of social, occupational, and/or other aspects of the child’s life. Impaired communication skills entail both verbal and nonverbal skills. Social skill abnormalities include lack of eye contact or atypical eye contact, failure to develop peer relationships, and lack of emotional reciprocity. Motor stereotypies, repetitive voluntary behaviors such as those described in the case, lack of flexibility, persistent preoccupation with specific objects or part of an object, and ritualistic patterns of behavior occur. When making a diagnosis of ASD, additional information should be specified, such as the presence of intellectual disability, accompanying language impairment, presence of catatonia, and if a medical, genetic, or environmental condition is associated (such as ASD associated with mitochondrial cytopathy). The severity of autism is graded as follows: level 1 (requires support), level 2 (requires substantial support), and level 3 (requires very substantial support). Asperger’s disorder and pervasive developmental disorder are no longer recognized as separate entities and now fall under the diagnosis called ASD. The ASD spectrum is broad, ranging from high-functioning individuals to nonverbal children with little interaction and no language skills. Cognitive delay is not a diagnostic criterion but may be an associated feature, although supranormal intelligence quotients (IQs) and savantism may (rarely) occur. Some improvements occur in adolescence, although seizures, mood disorders, or other comorbidities may also emerge. A genetic basis has been postulated given high concordance rates among monozygotic twins and increased incidence in families with more than one child with autism. Neuropathology seen in patients with autism includes underdevelopment of limbic structures and reduced cerebellar Purkinje cells. Several genetic and metabolic disorders have been associated with ASD, including neurofibromatosis 1, Down’s syndrome, fragile X mental retardation, fetal alcohol syndrome, and peroxisomal disorders, 1225 among others. A diagnostic workup for these disorders based on individual patient’s history and examination is indicated. This patient does not meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (see Chapter 13 ), and the history is not consistent with depression, particularly given his age. The patient’s clinical characteristics are consistent neither with Rett’s syndrome (discussed in question 60) nor with oppositional defiant disorder (discussed in Chapter 13 ).

Clinical features include presence of medial epicanthal folds, slanting palpebral fissures, micrognathia (small mouth) leading to an apparently large tongue, the so-called simian crease (in which there is a single palmar crease), Brushfield’s spots (white spots of depigmentation in the iris), clinodactyly (incurving of the fingers), short stature, and other features. In addition to varying degrees of intellectual disability, seizures (including infantile spasms), hematologic malignancies (such as leukemia), and congenital heart defects occur. Early dementia with Alzheimer-type pathology is seen, as the β-amyloid gene is on chromosome 21. These patients are at risk of cervical spinal cord compression due to atlantoaxial instability. Trisomy 13 or Patau’s syndrome is characterized by microcephaly, microphthalmia, iris coloboma, low-set ears, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly (excess number of fingers), prominence of the heels, and cardiac abnormalities. Life expectancy is typically not beyond early childhood. Trisomy 18 is characterized by microcephaly, ptosis, overlapping of the third finger over the second finger, rocker-bottom feet, umbilical hernia, congenital heart disease, and other findings.

Arrest of head growth with eventual (acquired) microcephaly, seizures, scoliosis, dysautonomia including respiratory dysfunction with apneas, and spasticity emerge as the disease progresses. Rett’s syndrome results from a mutation in the MECP2 gene located at Xq28 that encodes methyl CpG binding protein 2, which is involved in binding to methylated DNA, modulating gene expression. This X-linked disorder is most often seen in females, and it is thought to be most often fatal in boys, although cases of MECP2 mutations in male infants and children with intellectual disability and other features have been identified.

Tuberous sclerosis complex diagnostic criteria update: recommendations of the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference. Pediatr Neurol. 2013; 49:243–254.) Note that a definite diagnosis can be made with two major features or one major and two minor features. A possible diagnosis can be made with either one major feature or two or more minor features. The combination of lymphangioleiomyomatosis and angiomyolipomas without other features does not meet criteria for 1229 a definite diagnosis. A genetic diagnosis of TSC can be made by identifying TSC1 or TSC2 pathogenic mutation in DNA from normal tissue, in which the mutation clearly inactivates the function of either of these proteins. A normal result on genetic testing does not exclude TSC, since approximately 10% to 25% of patients with TSC have no mutation found on conventional genetic testing. Figure 14.11 shows three hypopigmented (hypomelanotic) patches known as ashleaf spots. These are not specific for TSC but occur in the majority of patients with TSC and are often present at birth but become more obvious with age; in newborns, examination under ultraviolet light (i.e., Wood’s lamp) makes them more apparent. Tinea corporis, a fungal infection, also leads to circular lesions on the trunk, but tinea has a different appearance. Figure 14.12 shows facial angiofibromas, also known as adenoma sebaceum, which are hamartomatous lesions consisting of vascular and connective tissue. They often become apparent in early childhood as papules in the malar region and become more apparent and numerous with time: they characteristically progress to involve the nasolabial folds and sometimes the chin. Facial angiofibromas may resemble acne if not examined closely and if other historical and clinical features are not taken into consideration. Shagreen patches are cutaneous hamartomas that have irregular borders and are raised. Shagreen patches most often occur on the trunk (back or flank). These lesions may not be present in childhood but may appear later in life. Hamartomas can occur in a variety of body parts in TSC including the retina and the gastrointestinal tract. The other disorders listed in the choices are also neurocutaneous disorders but with distinct cutaneous and other clinical features and with specific diagnostic criteria. Cutaneous neurofibromas are shown in Figure 14.6 and café au lait macules in Figure 14.5 ; these occur in neurofibromatosis (discussed in questions 46 to 48).

Another genetic disorder associated with developmental delay and a happy affect is Williams syndrome, which is associated with congenital heart disease, increased verbal abilities, and “elfin” facies, and is caused by deletions of approximately 26 genes on chromosome 7q. Prader–Willi and Angelman’s syndrome both result from a microdeletion on chromosome 15q11-q13.

Affected children appear normal at birth, becoming symptomatic within the first week of life, manifesting with lethargy, failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia, and respiratory distress. Hematologic abnormalities, including bleeding disorders leading to intracranial hemorrhage, may also occur. Patients who survive are left with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and recurrent acidosis. The diagnosis should be suspected in newborn patients with metabolic acidosis, ketosis, hyperglycinemia, and hyperammonemia. Methylmalonic acid is elevated in plasma and urine, and the enzyme activity can be analyzed in fibroblasts. B12- responsive forms of methylmalonic acidemia are associated with mutations in genes that affect the transport or synthesis of 5′- Deoxyadenosylcobalamin (cblA, cblB, or cblD variant 2 type), or deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. Patients with these forms may present later than patients with MUT mutations and may improve with specific forms of vitamin B12 supplementation. Patients with methylmalonic acidemia should be treated with protein restriction, and supplementation with intramuscular hydroxycobalamin and enteral carnitine. Antibiotics are also helpful to reduce the production of propionic acid by gut flora. In the acute setting, these patients need hydration and glucose administration with discontinuation of protein intake. This condition is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment in patients with the classic or severe form of the disease, though patients may become symptomatic before the newborn screening results return.

These cells are found in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and have large cytoplasm with striated appearance, what has been likened to “wrinkled tissue paper.” In the CNS, the brainstem and deep nuclei are most severely affected, and neuronal degeneration is seen, likely from neurotoxic action of glucosylsphingosine. For patients with Gaucher’s type 1, enzyme replacement with one of the three commercially available intravenous enzymes, imiglucerase, taliglucerase alfa, and velaglucerase alfa, can be effective for liver and spleen involvement and for the hematologic abnormalities. For those patients who cannot tolerate enzyme replacement, the oral substrate inhibitors eliglustat and miglustat are available and may be effective.

Tay–Sachs disease or infantile GM2 gangliosidosis is more common in Ashkenazi Jews, with heterogeneous carrier rates as high as 1:25 to 30 people, though carrier screening has reduced the incidence of Tay–Sachs disease in Ashkenazi populations by 90%. Other populations with higher incidence of Tay–Sachs disease include some French–Canadian families in Quebec, some Amish populations, and Cajun populations in Louisiana, though the disease may also occur in other populations with less frequency. In Tay–Sachs disease, the CNS is the only affected system, differentiating it from Sandhoff’s disease which affects both the CNS and the viscera, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly. Onset is between 3 and 6 months of age, with increased startle response and subsequent motor regression, spasticity, blindness with optic atrophy, and seizures. There is a delay in reaching developmental milestones, with subsequent developmental regression. A cherry- red spot in the macula is commonly seen, and these patients have macrocephaly. Progression to severe intellectual disability occurs, and most children die by the age of 5 years. The diagnosis is suspected in patients with psychomotor retardation and a cherry- red spot and is confirmed with the detection of hexosaminidase A deficiency with normal activity of hexosaminidase B. Targeted mutation analysis or gene sequencing of the HEXA gene to detect specific mutations may be helpful to identify asymptomatic carriers in the family and to differentiate between disease-causing mutations and so-called pseudodeficiency alleles that result in decreased hexosaminidase A activity in the laboratory but do not cause disease. Treatment of Tay–Sachs disease is supportive. Sandhoff’s disease occurs from combined deficiency of hexosaminidase A and B. The clinical features are similar to those seen in Tay–Sachs disease; however, as mentioned, in Tay–Sachs disease, the CNS is the only system involved, whereas in Sandhoff’s disease, the GM2 gangliosides accumulate in the brain and the viscera, causing hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis is based on these clinical features and confirmed with analysis of the enzymatic 1242 activity of the enzymes involved. Sandhoff’s disease rarely occurs in Ashkenazi Jewish populations.

(From Evans DG. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2): a clinical and molecular review [published online ahead of print June 19, 2009]. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2009;4:16. In contrast to NF1 (discussed in questions 46 to 48), cutaneous lesions such as café au lait spots and neurofibromas (see Figs. 14.5 and 14.6 ) are uncommon in NF2, but they may occur. On the contrary, various CNS tumors occur more commonly in NF2, often in the same patient, including schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas of the brain and spine. Lisch’s nodules are uncommon in NF2, but epiretinal membranes are common and subcapsular cataracts do occur. NF2 is one of the neurocutaneous syndromes that are often not diagnosed until adulthood. NF2 is autosomal dominant, with variable expression and complete penetrance. It results from a mutation in the MERLIN (also known as SCHWANNOMIN ) gene on chromosome 22. MERLIN is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene account for the various neoplasms seen in NF2. A variety of mutations in the NF2 gene have been identified, and the type of mutation correlates with clinical severity, with missense mutations leading to some functional protein production and milder clinical phenotype, and mutations with protein truncation leading to more severe disease. Gorlin’s syndrome and Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome are rare syndromes associated with multiple neoplasms, but this patient’s history of bilateral schwannomas combined with the family history is diagnostic of NF2. Tuberous sclerosis complex has distinct 1250 cutaneous and CNS findings as discussed in questions 61 to 63. Schwannomatosis is a distinct disorder characterized by the occurrence of multiple schwannomas affecting various CNs but not CN VIII. It may be segmental, and a pure spinal form also exists. It may be familial and has in some cases been associated with a mutation on chromosome 22 in a gene near but different from the gene mutated in NF2; a small percentage of cases of schwannomatosis are hereditary, with the majority being sporadic.

The diagnosis of MPS type I is based on elevated urinary excretion of dermatan and heparan sulfate and confirmed with enzyme analysis in leukocytes and fibroblasts. Pathologically, there are cells with vacuolated appearance, expansion of perivascular spaces in the CNS, and neuronal lipidosis. Electron microscopy (not light microscopy) demonstrates reticulogranular material in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and lamellar material in neurons, some of which adopt a layered appearance and are called zebra bodies. Enzyme replacement therapy can be used to treat non-CNS manifestations of the disease. Stem cell transplantation can be potentially helpful. Hunter’s syndrome or MPS type II is caused by a defect in iduronate sulfatase, with accumulation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. These patients have the Hurler phenotype but lack the corneal clouding and have characteristic nodular ivory-colored lesions on the back, shoulders, and upper arms. These children have short stature, macrocephaly, macroglossia, hoarse voice, hearing loss, visceromegaly, dysostosis multiplex, joint contractures, entrapment neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and intellectual disability. The diagnosis is based on mucopolysacchariduria and confirmed with analysis of the enzyme activity. Treatment is symptomatic. Other MPS include types III, IV, VI, VII, and IX as follows: • MPS type III or Sanfilippo’s syndrome has several subtypes (A, B, C, and D) and is associated with accumulation of heparan sulfate only. The main manifestation is intellectual disability. • MPS type IV or Morquio’s syndrome has two subtypes (A and B, see question 87), and they manifest with corneal clouding, dysostosis multiplex, and heart disease, with normal intelligence. • MPS type VI is also known as Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome and manifests with normal intelligence, dysostosis multiplex, corneal clouding, heart disease, and other features similar to Hurler’s syndrome. • MPS type VII is also known as Sly’s syndrome, and these patients have hydrops fetalis, intellectual disability, dysostosis 1256 multiplex, corneal clouding, and other features of Hurler’s syndrome. • MPS type IX is also known as Natowicz’s syndrome and is caused by deficiency of hyaluronidase with accumulation of hyaluronan.

Onset occurs after puberty, with acute attacks of abdominal pain, sometimes associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Commonly, these patients experience limb pain and muscle weakness resulting from a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly motor and axonal, affecting more proximal than distal segments and more the upper than the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are depressed. The radial nerve has been described as being classically involved, and in severe cases, there may be bulbar and respiratory involvement. Seizures can occur from neurologic involvement or may result from the hyponatremia that is seen in these patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, depression, disorientation, hallucinations, and paranoia may occur. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and elevated urinary excretion of ALA and PBG during the attacks. Genetic testing and enzyme analysis are also helpful. Management is focused on preventing attacks by avoiding precipitating factors. During attacks, these patients may need hospitalization for hydration and pain control. Carbohydrates decrease the synthesis of porphyrins and an infusion may be required. Hematin infusions may be helpful. For seizures, clonazepam and gabapentin may be helpful. Unfortunately, many AEDs precipitate attacks, especially barbiturates, which should be avoided. HCP is caused by coproporphyrinogen oxidase deficiency, and VP is caused by protoporphyrinogen oxidase deficiency. In both, the neurovisceral manifestations are similar to AIP, but in HCP and VP, there are cutaneous manifestations with photosensitivity, abnormal skin fragility, and bullous skin lesions on sun-exposed areas. HCP and VP cause increased urinary and fecal levels of coproporphyrin III. Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. 18th ed.

Other organ systems are involved, including the skeletal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract. Abnormal fullness of the cheeks, osteoporosis, and metaphyseal dysplasia are often seen. Cephalohematomas and spontaneous bone fractures are seen in newborns, which may raise the suspicion for nonaccidental trauma. In the classic presentation, patients present in the first months of life with hypotonia, hypothermia, failure to thrive, neurologic regression with severe developmental delay, and psychomotor retardation and seizures, with rapid progression and death by the third or fourth year of life. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from a mutation in ATP7A (Xq21.1), a copper transporter, resulting in defective copper transport across the intestines and across the blood–brain barrier, with low levels of copper in the plasma, liver, and brain. Various enzymes require copper as a cofactor, including cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, and lysyl oxidase among others. Histopathologically, the cortex, thalamus, and subcortical nuclei demonstrate loss of neurons and gliosis. The cerebellum shows loss of granular neurons and Purkinje cells. Laboratory studies demonstrate low serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper. The presence of subdural hematomas in an infant may raise question of nonaccidental injury, although the cutaneous findings and other manifestations allow the distinction to be made. Menkes disease is a disorder of copper deficiency in the liver and the brain, unlike Wilson’s disease, a disorder of copper accumulation in these organs, which is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene (13q14).

      "explicacao": "of the disease. The spectrum of this cognitive disorder includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), minor neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Usually, HAD is seen in patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3, with a diagnosis of AIDS. The etiology of this condition is the retrovirus itself rather than an opportunistic infection. Progressive cognitive decline and prominent psychomotor dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations. These patients have significant difficulties with attention and concentration, along with fine motor dysfunction, gait incoordination, and tremors. However, focal neurologic deficits are not common. CSF analysis is nonspecific, frequently revealing mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and slightly elevated protein levels. Neuropathological studies show diffuse white matter pallor, mononuclear infiltrates, multinucleated giant cells, and vacuolar changes in the brain. The main findings are in the subcortical region, and the cerebral cortex is relatively spared. Neuropsychologic testing is useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of these patients, as well as to monitor them while on therapy. HIV-associated dementia can be prevented by adequate early treatment of HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with the goals of attaining higher CD4 counts and suppressing the virus. Treatment of patients with HIV-associated dementia leads to improvements in neuropsychological performance. However, the prognosis is generally poor, likely given the late stage of HIV in which this condition develops. Given the cognitive impairment of these patients, successful treatment requires the use of simpler HAART regimens, with the least number of drugs and simple dosing intervals, and using a regimen that minimizes side effects. Complex regimens are associated with poor compliance. Family or friend support is very important, and directly observed therapy may be required. Besides HAART, there are no other specific therapies for HIV-associated dementia. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Patients usually present with fever, headache, neck stiffness, personality and behavioral changes, and altered mental status. Brain CT scan and MRI are performed to rule out other conditions and may demonstrate hydrocephalus, gelatinous pseudocysts, infarcts, or cryptococcomas. Lumbar puncture demonstrates an increased opening pressure, and CSF analysis shows mononuclear lymphocytosis with increased protein and low glucose levels. India ink smear is not very sensitive; however, it is useful when it is positive. Cryptococcal antigen detection in the CSF is rapid, sensitive and specific, and clinically useful, since fungal culture may take several days to weeks for a positive result to be obtained. The initial treatment regimen is amphotericin plus flucytosine for 2 to 3 weeks. These patients should be monitored closely, since amphotericin is associated with renal failure, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia; and flucytosine may cause hematologic abnormalities. If the patient is doing well on amphotericin and flucytosine, or the meningitis is mild, the treatment can be switched to fluconazole 200 mg twice daily for 8 to 10 weeks. Afterward, the patient should be kept on long-term maintenance therapy with fluconazole 200 mg daily to prevent recurrences. Highly active antiretroviral therapy, by promoting immune reconstitution, plays a major role in the long-term treatment of HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis, after the acute infection has cleared. Mortality rate in the acute setting may be related to elevated intracranial pressure, which should be treated. Patients with increased intracranial pressure may need frequent CSF drainage by repeated lumbar punctures or even ventriculostomy. Since this patient does not have a bacterial or tuberculous meningitis, there is no role for vancomycin, ceftriaxone, isoniazid, or rifampin. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Only those patients with severe immunosuppression develop clinical manifestations; PML in immunocompetent individuals is exceedingly rare but can occur. PML is a demyelinating condition and presents with a gradually progressive course of multiple focal neurologic manifestations, with visual field deficits and visual agnosias being common, given the predominant involvement of parieto-occipital regions. Hemiparesis, sensory deficits, language disorders and ataxia may occur. The diagnosis can be suspected with the history and clinical manifestations, supported with MRI findings and CSF JC virus DNA PCR, and confirmed with brain biopsy (though brain biopsy is not necessary in the setting of typical clinical, imaging, and CSF findings). MRI shows multiple white matter nonenhancing lesions that tend to coalesce and predominate in the parieto-occipital regions. Brain biopsy is the gold standard diagnostic test; neuropathologic findings include myelin loss, giant astrocytes, and altered oligodendrocytes, with enlarged nuclei and viral inclusions. On electronic microscopy, the viral particles give a “spaghetti and meatballs” appearance. The specimen shown in Figure 15.3 demonstrates enlarged oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusions consistent with PML. CSF JC virus DNA PCR is specific for the diagnosis, and brain biopsy is rarely necessary when this test is positive. Patients with PML have poor prognosis, as it denotes the presence of an already severely altered immune system. There is no specific therapy for this condition; however, some patients may improve with antiretroviral therapy and immune reconstitution. There are no specific EEG findings in PML, and acyclovir does not treat this condition. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

The bacterial agents spread via hematogenous routes or from a contiguous infected site, such as the sinuses, ears, or teeth. They also can be encountered after open trauma or neurosurgical interventions. Patients may present with fever, headaches, neck stiffness, focal neurologic findings, and altered mental status. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical suspicion and the presence of risk factors, along with clinical and radiologic findings, with the MRI showing ring enhancing lesions with surrounding edema. Lumbar puncture may be contraindicated in the presence of mass effect, and therefore CSF may not be available. The presence of atypical lymphocytes and monoclonal B cells in the CSF are seen in lymphoproliferative disorders and not in brain abscesses. Brain abscesses evolve through different stages, with initial cerebritis in the first few days, then the formation of central necrosis with surrounding vasogenic edema, and the subsequent formation of a capsule. The abscess eventually matures, with the development of collagenous tissue in the capsule and regression of the vasogenic edema. Caseating granulomas are not seen in cerebral bacterial abscesses. Optimal treatment requires drainage of the abscess in combination with intravenous antibiotics. Given that these lesions are most commonly polymicrobial, the treatment of choice is a combination of antibiotics, usually a third-generation cephalosporin (for streptococci and gram-negative bacilli), metronidazole (for anaerobes), and vancomycin (for staphylococci). The IV antibiotic regimen is continued for 6 to 8 weeks, and subsequent continuous oral antibiotics may be required beyond the initial treatment period. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used for cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is not the diagnosis in this patient. Antiretroviral therapy plays no role in the treatment of cerebral abscesses. These lesions are not typically caused by mycobacteria. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012."

PCR has higher sensitivity and may be helpful to make a diagnosis earlier. Brain MRI may be normal or may demonstrate meningeal enhancement, especially on the basal surface. Pathologic specimens show caseating granulomas, mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, and multinucleated giant cells as described in this case. Combinations of multiple anti-TB agents are used to kill the organisms and avoid inducing resistance. Commonly used medications are isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Usually, four drugs are initially administered for 2 months, after which the regimen can be reduced to two drugs that can be continued for several months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can affect the spinal cord and the brain parenchyma, where it can lead to the formation of tuberculomas. These lesions behave like space-occupying lesions, and the treatment is with anti-TB medications. Peripheral nerves are more commonly affected by Mycobacterium leprae rather than Mycobacterium tuberculosis; in leprosy, nerve thickening occurs, often with multiple mononeuropathies pattern (discussed in questions 29–30).

      "explicacao": "Mycobacterium leprae and is an important cause of neuropathy and skin disease worldwide. Most cases in the United States occur in immigrants, especially from Asia, the South Pacific, India, South America, and certain parts of Africa. Mycobacterium leprae is transmitted after prolonged and close contact with a patient with the disease, with an incubation period that is very long, lasting for years. The organism is thought to spread through the respiratory tract, from where it disseminates to other regions, especially the skin and superficial nerves, and mainly to cooler regions of the body. When invading the peripheral nerves, the mycobacterium tends to involve the Schwann cells preferentially. There are two main variants determined by the immune reaction against this mycobacterium, and these variants are the tuberculoid and lepromatous forms. In between these, there are three borderline variants: borderline tuberculoid, borderline intermediate, and borderline lepromatous forms. The tuberculoid variant presents in patients with strong cell-mediated immunity and an intense delayed hypersensitivity reaction, causing destruction of peripheral nerves and inflammatory lesions in the skin. These patients typically have demarcated hypopigmented lesions and areas of sensory loss, especially to temperature and pinprick. Peripheral nerves are involved, indurated, hypertrophic, and palpable, and sensory loss may be prominent, leading to trauma. Nerves predominantly involved are the ulnar, radial, common peroneal, sural, and greater auricular. Claw-hand from ulnar involvement and footdrop from common peroneal involvement may be present. The lepromatous form is present in patients with poor cell- mediated immunity with proliferation of the mycobacteria as they invade the tissues. It is characterized by skin infiltration by the mycobacteria, leading to diffuse cutaneous involvement in the coolest regions such as the pinna of the ear, tip of the nose, and dorsum of the hands and feet. Nerves may also be involved but usually at later stages. The treatment of Hansen disease is prolonged, usually with a combination of dapsone and rifampin, sometimes with the addition of clofazimine.

      "explicacao": "ischemic strokes and cortical superficial subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients with infective endocarditis can have a variety of neurologic complications, most likely from embolization of infected particles from the valvular vegetations. These neurologic manifestations include ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, meningitis, encephalitis, abscesses, vasculitis, and mycotic aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if they rupture. The exact mechanism of formation of mycotic aneurysms is not well known, but it is likely that they form secondary to septic emboli involving distal vessels, affecting their vasa vasorum, with destruction and weakening of the arterial wall and subsequent aneurysmal dilatation. These mycotic aneurysms are usually very distal in the arterial tree, and commonly seen in distal bifurcations. They are not typically seen in the proximal circle of Willis. The subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from rupture of these small aneurysms is usually cortical and superficial, and is not generally associated with vasospasm. Patients who suffer subarachnoid hemorrhage in the setting of infective endocarditis, should have a diagnostic cerebral angiogram to evaluate for the presence of mycotic aneurysms (or other potential cause of the subarachnoid hemorrhage). Some advocate for cerebral angiogram in patients with endocarditis and ischemic strokes or other signs of neurologic involvement, since mycotic aneurysms may be silent, however, this practice is still not widely recommended. Ruptured mycotic aneurysms should be treated surgically or endovascularly. Patients with infective endocarditis should be properly treated with early antibiotic therapy, which is mainstay of treatment. Antibiotics not only treat the cardiac infection but also prevents neurologic complications, and may potentially lead to resolution of unruptured mycotic aneurysms. Anticoagulants are generally contraindicated given the risk of rupture of silent or known mycotic aneurysms, as well as potential risk of hemorrhagic transformation of embolic strokes.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "syndrome. Infiltration of peripheral nerves would typically cause a sensorimotor predominantly axonal neuropathy. Infiltration of vertebral bodies can be extensive enough to lead to nerve root as well as spinal cord compression. Patients with plasma cell dyscrasias may develop encephalopathy due to hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity syndrome (due to hypergammaglobulinemia), and CNS infections, which such patients are prone to due to their immunocompromised state. Direct CNS involvement in plasma cell dyscrasias can occur but is relatively rare. POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) is a constellation of abnormalities seen in some patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, particularly plasmacytoma, and not with leukemias. Question 3 depicts a patient with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy associated with antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Patients with MGUS (which is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the absence of significant bone marrow involvement, anemia, renal failure, lytic lesions, or hypercalcemia) are at risk of developing symptomatic multiple myeloma. However, MGUS without evidence of other hematologic disorders can be associated with neuropathy. The neuropathy is often primarily demyelinating, and in some cases, particularly in patients with IgM MGUS, antibodies against MAG are detected in the serum. Neuropathy in patients with monoclonal proteinemias can also occur because of the presence of cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins are serum protein complexes that precipitate at specific temperatures. They occur in a variety of conditions as follows: Type I cryoglobulins are isolated monoclonal proteins (usually IgM) seen in the monoclonal paraproteinemias such as multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Type II cryoglobulins are polyclonal immunocomplexes (formed by monoclonal IgM and IgG), usually seen in lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders, and Hepatitis C virus infection. Type III cryoglobulins are polyclonal immunocomplexes (formed by polyclonal IgM and IgG) seen with underlying infectious and autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis). The 1353 most common neuropathic complication of cryoglobulinemia is generalized neuropathy, although mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex and cerebral vasculitis with ischemic stroke can also occur. While Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease can present in adulthood, it is unlikely in the absence of family history or other evidence of a hereditary neuropathy on examination (discussed in Chapter 9 ), and a costly genetic panel would not be of high yield. A technetium bone scan is not useful in investigating for the presence of bone lesions due to multiple myeloma (rather, plane film radiographs are used). Anti-GQ1b antibodies are typically seen in the Miller– Fisher variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome (discussed in Chapter 9 ). Genetic abnormalities of superoxide dismutase are detected in some patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (discussed in Chapter 11 ), which is not the diagnosis in this case.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Hypoglycemia may cause temporary focal deficits simulating stroke. Hyperglycemia, usually in the setting of a nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome, may also cause focal neurologic symptoms. Other metabolic abnormalities do not typically cause focal deficits. Hyponatremia typically causes more severe neurologic symptoms when it develops rapidly, but symptoms can also occur with chronic hyponatremia. A nonspecific encephalopathy is the most frequent manifestation. Seizures can occur with acute hyponatremia, usually with serum sodium levels of 115 mEq/L or less. Correction of serum sodium levels is the mainstay of treatment of hyponatremia-associated seizures, but care must be taken not to correct serum sodium levels too rapidly, given the risk of central pontine myelinolysis (discussed in Chapter 3 ). The rate of correction of hyponatremia should be no more than 12 mEq/L per day, or 0.5 mEq/L per hour. CNS manifestations of hypernatremia typically occur with serum sodium concentrations higher than 160 mEq/L and include encephalopathy, seizures, and in severe cases coma. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with peripheral rather than CNS manifestations. Hypokalemia can lead to myalgia and proximal limb weakness (with sparing of bulbar muscles). Rhabdomyolysis can occur with severe hypokalemia. Tetany may be a manifestation of hypokalemia (or hypocalcemia). Hyperkalemia is associated with muscle weakness in the context of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis or Addison disease, but rarely otherwise. Neurologic manifestations of hypercalcemia include encephalopathy and in severe cases coma. Other manifestations include headache and rarely seizures. Hyperparathyroidism can lead to depression, encephalopathy, and myopathy. Seizures are a much more common complication of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia also leads to tetany, which is due to spontaneous repetitive nerve action potentials. Initial symptoms of hypocalcemia include tingling in the perioral area and the digits. In more severe later stages, tonic muscle spasms occur, beginning in the fingers and toes (carpopedal spasm) but in some cases involving more proximal musculature; when the tetany involves truncal 1360 musculature, opisthotonos is present. Hypomagnesemia can lead to encephalopathy, tremor, myoclonus, and in severe cases seizures. Hypermagnesemia is rare, usually occurring in the setting of renal failure. Neurologic manifestations of severe hypermagnesemia include areflexia/hyporeflexia, and muscle weakness that when severe may progress to respiratory failure. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

Autonomic neuropathy is common in diabetics and can result in a variety of abnormalities including impotence, bladder dysfunction, abnormal pupillary reaction, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroparesis. Neuropathy can result from impaired glucose tolerance alone in patients not otherwise meeting laboratory criteria for diabetes. In fact, impaired glucose tolerance is often found in patients with otherwise idiopathic neuropathy, and treatment including diet and exercise may halt progression of the neuropathy. Diabetic polyneuropathy is irreversible, but slowing the progression is accomplished by adequate glycemic control. Painful neuropathy is treated with medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical agents such as capsaicin. Diabetic oculomotor palsy may present acutely and be associated with ipsilateral forehead pain. It results from ischemia to the third nerve; pupillomotor fibers are spared, given their more circumferential location, distinguishing it from other causes of acute oculomotor palsy such as cerebral aneurysms. Other cranial nerve palsies, particularly VI and VII, can occur in diabetes. CNS complications of diabetes may result from diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, both of which can lead to encephalopathy and in severe cases stupor and coma. Cerebrovascular disease due to atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis due to frequently comorbid hypertension can lead to various CNS manifestations resulting from ischemic stroke. Acute and sometimes permanent chorea can occur in patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Botelhoa MC, Conde MG, RebeloBraz NM.

      "explicacao": "syndrome often co-occurs with other autoimmune disorders. Constitutional symptoms are often present. Peripheral nervous system involvement in Sjögren syndrome manifests most commonly as a distal predominantly sensory or mixed sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. A sensory neuronopathy, or dorsal root ganglionopathy, as depicted in this case, may occur, and results from involvement of the dorsal root ganglia. With sensory neuronopathy, the sensory loss may not follow a length-dependent pattern but rather can affect the face or trunk before distal segments of the limbs (discussed further in Chapter 9). Sensory ataxia is often prominent in such cases. Other manifestations of Sjögren syndrome include isolated small-fiber neuropathy (without large-fiber involvement), autonomic neuropathy, and cranial neuropathy. CNS manifestations of Sjögren syndrome are uncommon but include cognitive dysfunction, focal brain lesions most often affecting subcortical white matter, aseptic meningitis, optic neuritis, and myelopathy. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of symptoms of xerostomia and xerophthalmia, objective documentation of xerophthalmia with Schirmer test, serologic testing for the autoantibodies anti-Ro (SSA) or anti-La (SSB), and/or minor salivary gland biopsy. Treatment is a combination of symptomatic therapies and immunosuppressants in some cases. This patient’s examination and nerve conduction findings are not consistent with an isolated small-fiber neuropathy, in which NCS are normal. Normal motor NCS would not be seen in a sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Churg–Strauss syndrome is discussed in questions 20 and 21. Small-fiber neuropathy due to systemic lupus erythematosus would not be associated with abnormal NCS, and other systemic features would be present. Vitamin B 12 deficiency can lead to a variety of neurologic manifestations (discussed in Chapter 17 ) but would not be associated with the dry eyes and mouth that this patient describes.

THC is active in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum.

In addition to these findings, common side effects include euphoria, drowsiness, analgesia, and constipation (hence the use of opiates and opiate derivatives as antidiarrheals). Opiate toxicity/overdose creates a “silent gut”, which can help in the diagnosis. Because of its cough suppressant effects, codeine is sometimes used in cough medicines. Treatment of suspected opiate overdose includes the opioid antagonist naloxone at 0.4 to 2 mg intravenously every 2 to 3 minutes. The diagnosis should be questioned if there is no response even after administration of 10 mg. Naltrexone is also an opioid antagonist, but used in longer-term treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence as opposed to naloxone, which is used in emergency settings. Flumazenil is given for benzodiazepine overdose. The dose of flumazenil is 0.2 to 0.5 mg intravenously every minute to a maximum total dose of 5 mg. Thiamine and glucose are not used for opiate overdose. Opiate withdrawal occurs within hours to several days of cessation. Withdrawal symptoms are often quite severe and cause significant functional impairment. They include dysphoria, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, diaphoresis, diarrhea, mydriasis, fever, and insomnia. Difficulty often exists in differentiating opiate from sedative (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines) withdrawal. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) can help in this differentiation because increased DTRs are typical in alcohol or sedative withdrawal but not opioid withdrawal. Therefore, if you see increased DTRs and give more opioids for suspected opioid withdrawal in the setting of actual sedative withdrawal, benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal seizures will be a likely complication. Opiates are one of multiple euphoria-producing drugs. All euphoria-producing drugs cause release of dopamine from the midbrain to the forebrain in the reward circuit (ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens). The caudate nucleus is included in this pathway. These areas contain especially high concentrations of dopaminergic synapses. The opiates also interact with other structures modulated by endorphins, including the amygdala, locus 1402 coeruleus, arcuate nucleus, thalamus, and the periaqueductal gray matter, which influence dopaminergic pathways indirectly. There are natural and synthetic forms of opiates. Opioid receptors are a group of G-protein coupled receptors, with opioids acting as ligands. The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, and endomorphins. There are four major subtypes of opioid receptors. The first is δ, including subtypes δ 1 and δ 2 . They are involved with analgesia, antidepressant effects, and physical dependence. The second is κ and includes κ 1 , κ 2 , and κ 3 . These are involved in spinal analgesia, sedation, miosis, and inhibition of antidiuretic hormone release. The third is μ and includes μ 1 , μ 2 , and μ 3 . The subtype μ 1 is involved in supraspinal analgesia and physical dependence; μ 2 is involved in respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, reduced gastrointestinal motility, and physical dependence. The actions of μ 3 are not clear. The fourth is ORL 1 /orphanin (or nociceptin receptor), which is involved in anxiety, depression, appetite, and development of tolerance to μ agonists.

Stroke and myocardial infarction can occur. Similar to all of the euphoria-producing drugs, there are effects of amphetamines and cocaine on the reward circuit (the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens). Withdrawal symptoms are also similar with amphetamines and cocaine and include dysphoria, vivid/unpleasant dreams, increased appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, agitation, or psychomotor retardation. The routes of amphetamine use are oral, nasal (snorting), inhalational (smoking), or intravenous.

      "explicacao": "Alcohol withdrawal can be quite severe and can even lead to death if not treated appropriately. Minor withdrawal symptoms begin within 6 to 36 hours from the last drink and include headache, tremors, diaphoresis, palpitations, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, anorexia, agitation, and anxiety. Mentation is preserved during this period. Seizures can occur generally 6 to 48 hours after the last drink. Alcoholic hallucinosis begins at 12 to 48 hours and includes hallucinations (mostly visual but can also be auditory and tactile), intact orientation, and stable vital signs. Delirium tremens occurs at 48 to 96 hours if adequate prophylaxis is not initiated and is characterized by delirium, hallucinations, disorientation, agitation, encephalopathy, hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, low-grade fever, and diaphoresis. In severe cases, delirium tremens can be fatal. β-Blockers and calcium channel blockers can be used for hypertension and tachycardia, although these will merely mask symptoms. Use of phenytoin or other anticonvulsants is appropriate in those with seizures and pre-existing epilepsy. This history is not present in the patient described, and antiepileptic agents are not indicated in this case. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam should be given as scheduled doses to prevent withdrawal symptoms (including seizures), and these are the most important medications to add in this setting. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms often occur in unrecognized alcoholic patients who are admitted for surgeries or other reasons. Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic used to treat insomnia, and not indicated in this setting. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Its use can also lead to hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and multiorgan failure. PCP is used by oral, intravenous, or intranasal routes. It acts as a noncompetitive antagonist at the glutamate NMDA receptor. PCP has been shown to affect biogenic amine (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) release and reuptake. These actions probably account for the sympathomimetic effects of PCP. PCP is structurally similar to ketamine, but it differs from ketamine in that it is longer acting, is more likely to cause seizures, and tends to cause more emergent confusion and delirium. Ketamine also acts as a noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor. It also has interactions with muscarinic, nicotinic, and cholinergic receptors and inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. The other choices listed are of the psychedelic or hallucinogenic category. Although some symptoms can overlap with PCP intoxication, the symptoms described in this case are characteristic of PCP. Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) comes from specific types of mushrooms, and mescaline comes from the peyote cactus. Lysergic acid is one of the ergot fungus’ diverse alkaloid components, and lysergic acid diethylamide was popularized as a potent mood-changing and hallucinogenic drug. Use of the different hallucinogens leads to many similar symptoms including sensory distortions (such as synesthesias; “feeling” colors, “seeing” sound), illusions, hallucinations, euphoria, anxiety, tachycardia, palpitations, pupillary dilation (as opposed to opiates, which cause miosis), and diaphoresis. The hallucinogens primarily work at various serotonergic receptors. Different receptor subtypes are modulated by these various drugs, some of which may do so through agonism, whereas others through antagonism. The serotonin 5HT 2 receptor is particularly thought to be involved in the action of these drugs. Some of these drugs may have some effects at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors. In addition, 3, 4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ecstasy, blocks 1408 reuptake of serotonin, and prolonged use of MDMA results in destruction of serotonergic neurons in the brain.

Vitamin B 12 is a cofactor for methionine synthase, which is involved in conversion of homocysteine to methionine and production of succinyl-CoA from methylmalonyl-CoA. Methionine is subsequently a precursor for S-adenosyl- L -methionine, which helps with methylation of myelin basic protein. Without this process, abnormal myelin structure results in neurologic deficit. The syndrome resulting from vitamin B 12 deficiency is called subacute combined degeneration because of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy combined with myelopathy, spastic paraparesis and posterior column dysfunction. Complete blood cell count may reveal a macrocytic anemia. Occasionally, vitamin B 12 levels may be in the low normal or even normal range despite true deficiency. If clinical suspicion is present for deficiency, the levels of metabolic intermediaries homocysteine and methylmalonic acid should be checked, both of which would be elevated in vitamin B 12 deficiency. Animal products (meat and dairy) provide the primary dietary source of vitamin B 12 for humans. This puts older adults, alcoholics, patients with malnutrition, and strict vegans at high risk for development of this deficiency. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "Arsenic is a naturally occurring element most commonly incorporated into organic or inorganic compounds, both of which are very toxic. It can also occur in gas form. With acute exposure, symptoms may develop within minutes to hours and usually begin with gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A garlic odor on the breath is characteristic. These symptoms can be followed by hypotension, dehydration, and cardiac and respiratory instability. Delirium, encephalopathy, coma, and seizures may occur. Other acute manifestations include proteinuria, hematuria, and acute tubular necrosis. If patients survive, within 1 to 3 weeks, they can develop hepatitis, pancytopenia, and a symmetric sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, which typically begins with distal paresthesias, followed rapidly by an ascending sensory loss and weakness, which mimics Guillain–Barré syndrome. The neuropathy can progress to intense burning pain, especially in the soles. In addition, dermatologic lesions can occur and may include alopecia, oral mucosal ulcerations, diffuse pruritic macular rash, and scaly rash on the palms and soles. A dry hacking cough and Mees lines (horizontal 1 to 2 mm white lines on the nails) may also occur. In chronic poisoning, the peripheral neuropathy and dermatologic symptoms are usually more prominent than the gastrointestinal symptoms. Cancers of the liver, bladder, kidney, skin, lung, nasal mucosa, and prostate have been reported with chronic exposure. After a suspected acute ingestion of arsenic, abdominal radiographs may reveal gastrointestinal radiopaque material. Urine arsenic levels are preferable to blood arsenic levels, but both can be used. Fish or shellfish intake within the previous 48 to 72 hours can cause falsely elevated levels of arsenic. For chronic exposure, hair and nail samples can be analyzed for the presence of arsenic, and 24-hour urine arsenic or spot urine arsenic and creatinine levels can be checked. Additional evaluations should include renal and liver function tests, complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and electrodiagnostic testing if there are symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. A distal sensorimotor axonopathy is the typical finding. Acute treatment includes fluid and electrolyte replacement, cardiac monitoring, activated charcoal, and chelation therapy. 1413 Chelation agents typically used include dimercaprol (British Anti- Lewisite) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer). Although symptoms can mimic Guillain–Barré syndrome, the constellation of clinical symptoms and signs described and adequate evaluation should have ruled this out. Cyanide and mercury poisoning are discussed in questions 30 and 31, respectively. Thallium causes acute gastrointestinal symptoms, confusion, painful (mostly sensory) neuropathy with autonomic features, and alopecia, which classically occurs about 2 to 4 weeks after ingestion. The clinical features including the reported garlic smell in her breath, as well as the timing, suggest the diagnosis of arsenic intoxication. Danan M, Dally S, Conso F.

Cyanide competes with oxygen and binds to the ferric ion (Fe3+) of cytochrome oxidase a 3 , which inhibits this final enzyme in the mitochondrial cytochrome complex, resulting in cessation of oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, cells cannot use oxygen in their electron transport chain and must switch to anaerobic metabolism. Because of the decreased utilization of oxygen by tissues, venous oxyhemoglobin concentration will be high, making venous blood appear bright red and thus, the bright red coloration of skin, similar to the effects of carbon monoxide. Cyanide also causes toxic oxygen free radicals, release of glutamate, and inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme that helps form the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA). CNS symptoms include headache, anxiety, abnormal taste, encephalopathy, vertigo, and seizures. Cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, initial tachycardia, and hypertension, then bradycardia and hypotension, atrioventricular block, and arrhythmias. Respiratory symptoms include initial tachypnea, then bradypnea and pulmonary edema. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Skin symptoms include flushing, cherry-red color. Cyanosis may occur late. Renal and hepatic failure may also occur. Laboratory evaluation reveals severe metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, elevated lactate level, and elevated blood cyanide level. Levels of more than 3.0 mg/L are fatal. Treatment must be initiated quickly, and includes removal of the cyanide source (such as from the skin) and activated charcoal. The Taylor Cyanide Antidote Package may be used. This includes amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. Hydroxocobalamin is also used to directly bind and neutralize cyanide and is often combined with sodium thiosulfate.

      "explicacao": "This woman has carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. It commonly occurs at the change of seasons as winter months approach and people turn on their furnaces. Other family members in the same household may have similar symptoms, which gives a clue to diagnosis. CO is an odorless, tasteless, colorless gas. It binds to the iron moiety of heme in hemoglobin with much higher affinity than does oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which results in impaired oxygen transport and utilization. It competes with oxygen in binding hemoglobin. This binding leads to a structural change, which limits the ability of the other three oxygen binding sites to release oxygen to peripheral tissues and hence the cherry-red flushed coloration. It can also lead to CNS lipid peroxidation and delayed neurologic sequelae. Some sources include poorly functioning heating systems and improperly vented fuel-burning devices such as kerosene heaters, charcoal grills, camping stoves, gasoline-powered generators, and motor vehicles. Symptoms most commonly include headache, nausea, malaise, dizziness, and cherry-red skin coloration. Severe toxicity can cause seizures, encephalopathy, coma, and cardiovascular instability. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels (which may be normally elevated to an extent in smokers). Treatment should include high-flow 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather mask. In severe cases, histopathology in chronic stages reveals necrosis in the globus pallidus and confluent areas of necrosis in subcortical white matter. Ernst A, Zibrak JD. Carbon monoxide poisoning.

      "explicacao": "lead intoxication as lead-based paint in old houses has been a frequent etiology, especially in children. Many other occupational exposures are possible but would be seen more in adults. Lead inhibits the sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes such as γ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase in heme synthesis, which causes disruption of hemoglobin synthesis and leads to the production of free erythrocyte protoporphyrins. Lead also competes with calcium in several biologic systems and processes, such as mitochondrial respiration and nerve functions, and has been implicated as contributing mechanisms in neurotoxicity. Common symptoms of lead toxicity include abdominal pain (lead colic), constipation, myalgias, arthralgias, seizures, psychomotor slowing, headache, and anorexia. Basophilic stippling of red blood cells and microcytic hypochromic anemia are often seen. In addition, a bluish pigmentation at the gum-tooth line is sometimes seen. A peripheral neuropathy classically with extensor weakness or “wrist/ankle drop” is associated with lead toxicity and is due to an axonal degeneration that primarily affects motor nerves. Generally, removal from the lead source is the only treatment needed, although chelation therapy with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer), and calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate are also available.

      "explicacao": "Often these patients will develop the “intermediate syndrome,” approximately 12 to 96 hours after exposure that consists of weakness, fasciculations, tachycardia, hypertension, decreased deep tendon reflexes, cranial nerve abnormalities, proximal muscle weakness, and respiratory insufficiency. In addition, some organophosphates can cause organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy, occurring 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Symptoms include painful but transient “stocking-glove” paresthesias followed by a symmetrical motor polyneuropathy with flaccid weakness of the lower extremities, which ascends to the upper extremities. Neurobehavioral symptoms may also occur as chronic sequelae. Atropine competes with acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors to help prevent cholinergic activation. Since atropine does not bind to nicotinic receptors, it is ineffective in treating neuromuscular dysfunction, so the cholinesterase-reactivating agent pralidoxime is typically given concurrently with atropine and is effective in treating manifestations resulting from activation of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Benzodiazepines are used for organophosphate-related seizures and sometimes for seizure prophylaxis. Activated charcoal is recommended if presentation is within 1 hour of ingestion. Gastric lavage is not recommended as mentioned earlier. Eddleston M, Roberts D, Buckley N. Management of severe organophosphorus pesticide poisoning. Crit Care. 2002;6(3):259 . Moretto A, Lotti M.

      "explicacao": "This patient describes symptoms most consistent with botulism, likely related to foodborne source from home canning. Botulism is a potentially life-threatening neuroparalytic syndrome resulting from exposure to botulinum toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum. There are at least eight distinct types of botulinum toxin, although the most commonly involved is botulinum toxin A. There are multiple forms of botulism including foodborne botulism (ingestion of food contaminated by botulinum toxin), wound botulism (infection of a wound by C. botulinum, with subsequent production of neurotoxin), infantile botulism (ingestion of clostridial spores that then colonize the gastrointestinal tract and release toxin), adult enteric infectious botulism (toxin produced in the gastrointestinal tract), and inhalational botulism (aerosolized toxin related to acts of bioterrorism). Botulinum toxin binds to the synaptotagmin II receptor on presynaptic cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions. After the heavy chain of the toxin binds to the receptors, the light chain translocates into the nerve cell via endocytosis. Upon entering the cytoplasm, the toxin irreversibly inhibits acetylcholine release by cleaving various proteins involved in neuroexocytosis of acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin A and E cleave SNAP-25; botulinum toxin C cleaves SNAP-25 and syntaxin; and botulinum B, D, F, and G cleave synaptobrevin. Reversal of this inhibition requires sprouting of a new presynaptic terminal and formation of a new synapse. This generally takes 3 to 6 months. Although the toxin can be quite harmful, these effects are used for therapeutic purposes, such as for the treatment of dystonia, spasticity, and other neurologic disorders. Symptoms related to foodborne botulism may begin within 12 to 36 hours after ingestion of the toxin but may be delayed for several days. Symptoms include acute onset of multiple cranial neuropathies, blurred vision (due to fixed pupillary dilation), symmetric descending weakness, urinary retention, and constipation. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting often precede neurologic symptoms in foodborne botulism. Symptoms in this case are not consistent with myasthenia gravis (there is no diurnal variation or other historical points to suggest 1422 fatigability; discussed in Chapter 10 ), Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (discussed in Chapter 10 ), or Guillain–Barré syndrome (which presents with ascending, not descending, weakness and without pupillary involvement; discussed in Chapter 9 ). He has no history of cancer and is otherwise healthy, making leptomeningeal carcinomatosis unlikely, especially with the abrupt onset of symptoms. Hughes JM, Blumenthal JR, Merson MH, et al.
