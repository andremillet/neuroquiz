      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "A brain CT scan should be obtained before any therapy is started. This patient’s clinical presentation is consistent with acute stroke. If this is an acute ischemic stroke, and there are no contraindications, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should be given since the patient presented within the time window for this therapy. When a patient presents to the emergency department with acute onset of focal neurologic symptoms suggestive of a stroke, and if stable from the hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint, steps should be taken to ensure appropriate treatment in a timely manner. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a point system utilized to assess patients presenting with a stroke in which different neurologic functions are examined, including consciousness; vision and eye movement; movement of the face, arms and legs; sensation; coordination; speech; and language. Points are given for impairments of these functions. The maximum score is 42, with higher scores representing worse neurologic deficits. In a patient presenting with acute neurologic symptoms, the first thing to do is to obtain a brain CT scan to rule out an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). A brain CT scan will also help to determine if there are other structural lesions and/or already established ischemic changes. If there is no evidence of hemorrhage, an exclusion criteria checklist should be assessed, and if there are no contraindications and the patient is within the time window, 146 intravenous tPA should be given. The dose is 0.9 mg/kg, with a 10% bolus and the rest over 1 hour, with a maximum dose of 90 mg. The time window for intravenous tPA administration approved on the basis of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) tPA trial is 3 hours. Based on the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 3 (ECASS3), intravenous tPA is safe and beneficial up to 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms. Between 3 and 4.5 hours from the onset of symptoms, additional exclusion criteria for intravenous tPA administration include: age >80 years, NIHSS >25, use of oral anticoagulants and a combined history of stroke and diabetes mellitus. Aspirin may be given if intravenous tPA is not administered however a CT scan is a priority to rule out ICH. Intravenous heparin should not be used routinely in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. A brain MRI is sensitive to detect infarcted tissue, however, is not practical, since it takes time to obtain, and is not widely available in an emergency setting. Hacke W, Kaste M, Bluhmki E, et al.

In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, headache is the most frequent symptom, seen in about 90% of cases in adults. Given the occlusion of venous drainage along with hemorrhagic infarct and edema, patients may develop increased intracranial pressure. Diplopia caused by a sixth cranial nerve palsy is nonspecific, has nonlocalizing value and may be a manifestation of increased intracranial pressure. In patients with venous infarcts, focal neurologic findings will be present depending on the area affected along the thrombosed venous sinus. Thrombosis of the deep venous system may lead to deep venous infarcts, including bilateral thalamic infarcts. This is not seen with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, which instead can lead to infarcts in the parasagittal cortex bilaterally along the sinus. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP.

A lateral medullary infarct is caused by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), and is often associated with occlusion of the vertebral artery. Wallenberg’s syndrome, or lateral medullary syndrome, involves the following structures: • Vestibular nuclei, causing vertigo, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. • Descending tract and nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve, producing impaired sensation on the ipsilateral hemiface. • Spinothalamic tract, producing loss of sensation to pain and temperature in the contralateral hemibody. • Sympathetic tract, manifesting with ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome with ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. • Fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves, presenting with hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, and decreased gag reflex. • Cerebellum and cerebellar tracts, causing ipsilateral ataxia and lateropulsion. • Nucleus of the tractus solitarius, causing loss of taste. Patients may present with combinations of these manifestations and not always with a complete syndrome. Other clinical manifestations, such as hiccups, are typically seen in this syndrome, but may not be explained by a lesion to a specific structure in the brainstem.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "149 This patient likely has a left vertebral artery dissection causing a lateral medullary syndrome. The most common site of a vertebral dissection is at the level of C1-C2, where the artery is mobile as it is leaving the transverse foramina to enter the cranium. The gold standard diagnostic test for an arterial dissection is a catheter angiogram to evaluate the cervicocerebral arteries, which will demonstrate the narrowing of the vessel, the extension of the dissection with an intimal flap, or double lumen. However, a catheter angiogram is an invasive test with potential risks, including the risk of causing or worsening an existing dissection. CT angiogram and MRA with contrast are helpful for the diagnosis of an arterial dissection, and have replaced a catheter angiogram for the diagnosis of dissection of the cervical arteries. MRA with a time-of-flight sequence may also be helpful to assess the flow at the site of the dissection; however, it does not provide information about the vessel wall. When evaluating a possible vertebral artery dissection, limiting the evaluation to the circle of Willis may miss a potential dissection in the cervical portions of the vessel. An MRI with fat-suppression technique is helpful to assess the vessel wall and surrounding tissues, and very useful in nonocclusive dissections, when conventional angiogram will not give information about the vessel wall. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and is useful in the initial assessment; however, the dissection may not be visualized, and ultrasound may not be able to determine the extent of the dissection, especially in the vertebral arteries, which are not completely visualized with ultrasonography. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is less useful and does not provide direct visualization of the dissection. An echocardiogram with bubble study is not indicated for evaluation of vessel dissection. Patients with arterial dissections may have strokes either from vessel occlusion or from embolism originating in the dissected vessel wall. Treatment ranges from antiplatelet agents to anticoagulation, and in some cases endovascular techniques to open the vessel. No significant difference in efficacy has been found between antiplatelet and anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with dissection of 150 the cervical vessels.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a thrombolytic agent that is used intravenously for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Earlier administration correlates with better prognosis and lower risk of hemorrhage when compared with later administration of the medication. The tPA for acute ischemic stroke trial was published in 1995 and performed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Study Group. In this trial, intravenous tPA was given to eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours from onset of symptoms. These patients were given 0.9 mg/kg of the drug, 10% as a bolus, and the rest over 1 hour. The maximum dose is 90 mg. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurred in 6.4% of the patients who received intravenous tPA, compared with 0.6% in those who received placebo. The time window from symptom onset to allowable time for tPA administration was 3 hours; however, it was determined that the earlier the administration, the better the prognosis and the lower the risk of hemorrhage. Patients who received intravenous tPA had improved clinical outcomes and were at least 30% more likely to have minimal or no disability at 3 months. The mortality at 3 months was 17% in the tPA group and 21% in the placebo group. Administration of intravenous tPA is indicated in patients with an acute ischemic stroke presenting within 3 hours from symptom onset when no contraindications are identified. 151 Based on the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 3 (ECASS3), the use of intravenous tPA between 3 and 4.5 hours from the onset of symptoms has been shown to be beneficial in select patients. However, four additional exclusion criteria exist: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >25, age >80, history of both stroke and diabetes, and any anticoagulant use, regardless of prothrombin time or INR.

      "explicacao": "This patient had transient monocular blindness or amaurosis fugax, which may be caused by atherosclerotic stenosis of the ipsilateral ICA, in this case the right side. The retinal artery originates from the ophthalmic artery, which is a branch of the ICA. Transient occlusion of the retinal or ophthalmic arteries may manifest as amaurosis fugax. Amaurosis fugax is often described as a painless visual loss: a “shade” or “curtain” moving in the vertical plane, with a rapid onset and brief duration of a few minutes. Vision is most commonly recovered completely; however, the presentation of amaurosis fugax in a patient with an underlying ICA stenosis, may herald the occurrence of a stroke. For this reason, when a patient complains of amaurosis fugax, investigations should be obtained to rule out carotid stenosis, and establish appropriate treatment. Other rare but potential causes include giant cell arteritis, and embolism from other source. The other options listed do not correlate with the presentation of amaurosis fugax. Whenever a patient presents with visual symptoms, it is important to obtain detailed information to determine if the visual phenomenon involves the eye or the visual fields. Having the patient close one eye and then the other (or ask 152 if he/she was able to determine if the visual phenomena was involving one eye or the other) can help distinguish a process that is affecting the eye from one that is affecting the visual pathways and visual cortex. In general, a condition that affects vision in the visual fields of both eyes is most likely related to a problem in the visual pathways and/or visual cortex. A visual phenomenon only affecting one eye is in general most likely an ocular problem. Goetz CG. Textbook of Clinical Neurology. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders Elsevier; 2007.

The P1 segment of the PCA gives rise to interpeduncular branches that will provide vascularization to the medial thalamus.

In some cases, a single artery called the artery of Percheron will arise from the P1 segment on one side and will supply the medial thalami bilaterally. This is a normal variant. If an occlusion of the artery of Percheron occurs, the result will be an infarct in the medial thalamic structures bilaterally. The anterior choroidal arteries do not supply the medial thalamus. The recurrent artery of Heubner is a branch of the ACA that supplies the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the inferior part of the head of the caudate, and the anterior part of the globus pallidus. The pericallosal artery is one of the subdivisions of the ACA, running along the corpus callosum, and does not supply the thalamus.

      "explicacao": "This patient presents with pure sensory symptoms, which can be seen in a pure sensory lacunar infarct. A lacunar stroke occurs from occlusion of a small penetrating artery, as a consequence of chronic hypertension. Diabetes and hyperlipidemia also play a role but to a lesser degree. These small vessels develop lipohyalinosis with vessel wall degeneration and luminal occlusion. Atherosclerosis of the parent vessel may occlude the opening of these small penetrating branches, or predispose to the entry of embolic 154 material that will occlude them. Lacunar infarcts occur in the putamen, caudate nuclei, thalamus, basis pontis, internal capsule, and deep hemispheric white matter. Symptoms will depend on the location, and several syndromes have been reported including the following: • Pure motor, usually involving face, arm, and leg equally, and the most frequent location is in the territory of the lenticulostriate branches, affecting the posterior limb of the internal capsule, but has also been described with lacunes in the ventral pons. • Pure sensory, with hemisensory deficit involving the contralateral face, arm, trunk, and leg from a lacune in the thalamus. • Clumsy-hand dysarthria occurs more frequently from a lacune in the paramedian pons contralateral to the clumsy hand, but it may also occur from a lacune in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. • Ataxic hemiparesis, in which the ataxia is on the same side of the weakness, but out of proportion to the weakness, and this occurs from lacunes in the pons, midbrain, internal capsule, or parietal white matter. The clinical manifestations of these lacunar infarcts may have a sudden onset; however, it is not infrequent to see a stepwise “stuttering” progression of the neurologic deficits over minutes, and sometimes over hours to even days. This patient should undergo evaluation, and MRI with diffusion- weighted sequences should be obtained. Even though diabetes control is important, hypertension plays a major role in the pathogenesis of lacunar strokes, and strict blood pressure control may prevent further events.

This patient has Broca’s or motor aphasia, in which she is able to understand and follow commands but cannot verbalize. It is common for these patients to seem frustrated since they can understand and know what they want to say but cannot speak. Broca’s aphasia occurs from ischemia in the territory of the superior division of the MCA affecting the dominant inferior frontal gyrus. On the other hand, ischemia in the territory of the inferior division of the MCA in the dominant hemisphere will cause Wernicke’s rather than Broca’s aphasia. 156 A left MCA trunk occlusion will likely produce a global aphasia, and will also produce ischemia in the lenticulostriate arteries’ territory, therefore presenting with hemiparesis or hemiplegia affecting face, arm, and leg. An infarct in the territory of the lenticulostriate branches will not present with cortical findings such as aphasia. A pontine stroke will not produce a brachiofacial hemiparesis with motor aphasia.

These findings are consistent with an infarct in the lateral medulla on the right side. Wallenberg’s syndrome, or lateral medullary syndrome, involves the following structures: • Vestibular nuclei, causing vertigo, nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. • Descending tract and nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve, producing impaired sensation on the ipsilateral hemiface. • Spinothalamic tract, producing loss of sensation to pain and temperature in the contralateral hemibody. • Sympathetic tract, manifesting with ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome with ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. • Fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves, presenting with hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, and decreased gag reflex. • Cerebellum and cerebellar tracts, causing ipsilateral ataxia and lateropulsion. • Nucleus of the tractus solitarius, causing loss of taste.

A basilar occlusion can cause a pontine infarct and will possibly result in a locked-in syndrome, or could possibly cause extensive brainstem infarction resulting in brain death. Basilar occlusion may occur from local thrombosis of the basilar artery itself, thrombosis of both vertebral arteries, or thrombosis of a single vertebral artery when it is the dominant vessel. Embolism can occur as well, frequently lodging distally in the vessel. Wallenberg’s syndrome occurs from an infarct of the lateral medulla, and is usually caused by involvement of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), or the parent vertebral artery. Parinaud’s syndrome is characterized by supranuclear paralysis of eye elevation, defect in convergence, convergence-retraction nystagmus, light-near dissociation, lid retraction, and skew deviation of the eyes. The lesion is localized in the dorsal midbrain and is classically seen with pineal tumors compressing the quadrigeminal plate; however, it can occur from midbrain infarcts. This patient does not have significant disease of the left MCA. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome is caused by thalamic infarct, and even though this patient may have lesions in the thalamus, other manifestations are more likely to predominate. Goetz CG.

This condition is intimately related to hypertension. The pathologic basis of lacunes is lipohyalinosis of small penetrating branches but not microhemorrhages. Given that this is a disease of small vessels, studies to look for a cardioembolic source are likely to be of low yield. However, transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac monitorization are usually obtained as part of the stroke work up. Given the location of the lacune in this case, it is unlikely for this patient to present with a pure sensory syndrome, which will be seen more frequently with thalamic lacunes.

Mimics of hyperdense MCA sign, also known as pseudohyperdense sign, include vascular calcification, increased hematocrit, and intravenous contrast. Other early signs (within 6 hours) of ischemic stroke on CT scan include loss of the insular ribbon, attenuation of the lentiform nucleus, and hemispheric sulcal effacement. This patient does not have a hypertensive hemorrhage. There is no evidence on CT scan of SAH to suspect the development of vasospasm. An MCA occlusion is a large vessel occlusion and does not represent a lacunar stroke. An MCA occlusion resulting in a large hemispheric stroke may require hemicraniectomy, but not suboccipital craniectomy, which may be recommended in large cerebellar strokes. Jha B, Kothari M.

Watershed infarcts manifest clinically with proximal weakness, affecting the proximal upper and proximal lower extremities, with weakness at the shoulder and at the hip. This occurs because the watershed regions correlate with the homuncular representation of the proximal limbs and trunk. In severe cases of bilateral watershed infarcts, a “person-in-a-barrel” syndrome occurs, in which the patient can only move the distal part of the extremities. 166 The clinical history of hypotension and subsequent neurologic findings correlates with watershed ischemic events. Given the unilateral involvement and the clinical history, this is not a myopathy. An infarct in the internal capsule will not produce the clinical picture that this patient has. A cardioembolic event is also less likely given the clinical presentation. Given the left side weakness, it is likely that there is a stenosis in the right and not the left carotid. Blumenfeld H.

      "explicacao": "168 Anterior circulation aneurysms have a lower risk of rupture when compared with posterior circulation aneurysms. Intracranial aneurysms are most often acquired and sporadic; however, there are associations with various conditions, including AVMs, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, Marfan’s syndrome, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Aneurysms can also be familial, and screening with CTA or MRA is recommended in patients with two or more family members with an intracranial aneurysm or history of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral aneurysmal rupture leads to SAH, which is a serious, sometimes fatal event. In a patient with an unruptured cerebral aneurysm, the presence of certain factors may be associated with higher risk of rupture, and this may influence treatment decision. Risk of rupture and SAH depends on various factors. Size is important, and larger aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture. Some studies have suggested that the risk of rupture is significantly higher with diameters of 7 mm or higher, and the risk rises with increasing size. Aneurysmal growth may be associated with increased risk of rupture, and patients presenting with a growing aneurysm on imaging, or new symptoms from aneurysm growth (new cranial nerve palsy or mass effect) should undergo treatment. Aneurysm location is also an important factor, and posterior circulation aneurysms (vertebrobasilar aneurysms, including posterior communicating artery aneurysms) are at higher risk for rupture as compared to anterior circulation aneurysms. Smoking and uncontrolled hypertension are also risk factors for aneurysmal rupture, and these conditions should be treated. Patients with previous aneurysmal rupture are at higher risk for SAH. Treatment decision should be made with the patient based on several factors, including aneurysm size, location, and characteristics (like the presence of daughter sacs), patient’s age, risk factors, and comorbidities. Unruptured aneurysms could be managed conservatively (imaging surveillance and observation in those patients with low risk of aneurysmal rupture), by endovascular treatment (coiling), or by surgical treatment (clipping). In selected aneurysms, endovascular coil embolization is associated with reduced procedural morbidity and mortality as 169 compared to surgical clipping; however, the recurrence risk may be higher. Selection of endovascular management or surgical treatment also depends on the age of the patient and other comorbidities, size of the aneurysm, location and morphology, as well as the experience of the center where the patient is being treated.

Figure 2.11 shows a left occipital infarct, in the distribution of the left PCA, which will likely cause a homonymous hemianopia in the contralateral side, in this case in the right visual hemifield. Typically, PCA strokes spare central vision because of collateral blood supply to macular cortical representation. Occipital strokes in the dominant hemisphere may manifest with alexia (inability to read), anomia, achromatopsia (color anomia), and other visual agnosias. Patients with left occipital infarcts involving the splenium of the corpus callosum may present with the classical alexia without agraphia. This syndrome occurs because the patient cannot see what is placed in the right visual hemifield, and whatever can be seen in the left visual hemifield will be represented in the right occipital cortex, but due to corpus callosum involvement this information cannot be connected with language centers in the left hemisphere.

Superior division MCA strokes predominantly involve the frontal lobe and will manifest with Broca’s (or expressive) aphasia. Inferior division MCA strokes predominantly involve the temporal lobe and will manifest with Wernicke’s (or receptive) aphasia. In this case, given the extent of the lesion involving nearly the entire left MCA, the patient will most likely have global aphasia. With MCA strokes, the frontal eye fields may be involved, and patients will have gaze deviation toward the hemisphere involved. This occurs because the contralateral frontal eye fields will be unopposed, “pushing” the eyes to the side of the infarct. Given that optic radiations are also involved during their course within the territory of the MCA, a contralateral homonymous hemianopia is expected. In this case a right homonymous hemianopia. Patients with MCA strokes present with contralateral hemiparesis. If the stroke predominantly involves the cortex, the weakness will be more prominent in the face and arm than in the 171 leg, as the cortical leg area is supplied by the ACA. If the infarct extends to the subcortical region affecting the corona radiata or internal capsule, the patient could have a dense hemiplegia involving face, arm, and leg equally. Weakness that involves the leg more than the face and arm is characteristic of anterior cerebral infarctions, and is not typically seen with MCA infarctions.

The other cases listed in the options should be managed with oral anticoagulation. Results of the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial suggested that oral anticoagulation with warfarin was associated with more adverse events and provided no benefit over aspirin in the prevention of cerebrovascular events in the setting of intracranial atherosclerotic disease. Use of oral anticoagulation is indicated in the prevention of strokes from a cardioembolic source, and this therapy is not indicated or is controversial in the setting of atherothrombotic etiologies. A patient with intracardiac thrombus should also be treated with anticoagulation. In the setting of acute anterior wall myocardial infarction with anterior wall akinesis and depressed ejection fraction, the use of anticoagulation should be contemplated, since the risk of formation of intramural thrombus is high in these patients. However, in patients in sinus rhythm with low ejection fraction, the use of warfarin is not superior when compared to aspirin, and anticoagulation may increase the risk of hemorrhage. Treatment with oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation, and in these cases, risk stratification (several scores are available such as CHADS 2 or CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score) should be calculated to evaluate if treatment with oral anticoagulants is indicated, or if antiplatelet agents 172 would suffice depending on the stroke risk (discussed in question 58). Other considerations such as risk of hemorrhage (as in patients with high fall risk) should be assessed. Certainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, heart rate control is required, and as suggested by the AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management) trial, rhythm control does not confer benefit when compared with rate control. In general, oral anticoagulation with warfarin should target an INR between 2.0 and 3.0, except in the setting of mechanical valves, in which the target INR is 2.5 to 3.5. Direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors are novel oral anticoagulants recommended for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and used more frequently in recent years (discussed in question 70).

The hemiplegia affecting face, arm, and leg is explained by involvement of not only the motor cortex and corona radiata, but also the internal capsule, which is supplied by the lenticulostriate arteries that originate from the stem of the MCA prior to the bifurcation. 173 An occlusion at this site also explains the cortical findings such as the aphasia. In superior division left MCA strokes, Broca’s (expressive) aphasia is more common, whereas Wernicke’s (receptive) aphasia is seen more often with inferior division left MCA strokes. In this case, the global aphasia is better explained by an MCA trunk occlusion affecting both divisions. Gaze deviation to the left is caused by unopposed action of the right frontal eye fields. The right homonymous hemianopsia is caused by interruption of the geniculocalcarine radiations running within the left hemisphere. A stroke caused by occlusion of the left lenticulostriate branches only will not explain the aphasia and the other neurologic findings except the hemiplegia. An infarct isolated to the individual MCA segments after the first bifurcation will not explain the hemiparesis affecting also the lower extremity, nor the global aphasia.

The right and left ACAs connect via the anterior communicating artery. Beyond this point, the ACA will continue around the genu of the corpus callosum, bifurcating into the pericallosal and callosomarginal arteries. The ACA gives rise to various small branches, including the recurrent artery of Heubner, which is a deep penetrating branch that originates in the proximal ACA. The MCA originates from the ICA. The MCA main trunk before the bifurcation gives off many small penetrating vessels called the lenticulostriate arteries, which supply large regions of the basal ganglia and the internal capsule.

Evidence of infarcted tissue on CT scan may suggest a longer time from the onset of symptoms than initially thought.

The SAMMPRIS (Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis) trial compared best medical therapy versus intracranial stenting in patients with intracranial stenosis (70% to 99% stenosis) and recent stroke or TIA, demonstrating that medical therapy is superior. The rate of early stroke was high in the stent group, and lower than expected in the medical therapy group. Medical management in the study included aspirin 325 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 90 days, optimal management of risk factors (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg, and <130 mm Hg in diabetics, and target LDL <70 mg/dL), and lifestyle modifications. Based on this study, intracranial angioplasty and stenting is not recommended for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis given its periprocedural risk and high stroke rate when compared to low risk of stroke events on optimal medical therapy. For recurrent ischemic events despite medical therapy, angioplasty or angioplasty and stenting are considered investigational. There is no evidence to support angioplasty alone. The Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial randomized patients with a recent TIA or stroke with a 50% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery to warfarin or aspirin, and concluded that warfarin was associated with higher rates of adverse events and provided no benefit over aspirin.

This can be useful to guide treatment with intravenous tPA by helping identify patients who will unlikely make an independent recovery. To obtain the ASPECT score, two axial cuts are obtained on the CT, one at the level of the basal ganglia and thalamus, and another more cranial cut where these structures are not appreciated. On these slice cuts, there are 10 regions of interest, of which 4 are deep and defined as the caudate, the internal capsule, the lentiform nucleus, and the insular region, and 6 regions are cortical. These regions are assigned a point, which is subtracted if there is early ischemic change in that specific region. A normal looking CT scan will obtain a maximum of 10 points, and a score of 0 is consistent with diffuse ischemic injury of the entire MCA territory. The lower the number of points the larger the infarct that is already being seen on CT. 180 The ASPECTS correlates inversely with the severity of the stroke, and patients with low scores should not be treated with thrombolytic agents.

      "explicacao": "The anterior choroidal artery is a branch of the ICA and arises from the communicating segment (or supraclinoid ICA segment). Various classifications have been proposed for the segments of the ICA, with that by Bouthillier et al. being one of the most widely used and the basis for the following discussion. The cervical (C1) segment of the ICA, beginning at the level of the common carotid artery and ending where the ICA enters the carotid canal in the petrous bone. It has no branches. The petrous (C2) segment of the ICA runs within the carotid canal in the petrous bone. Vidian and caroticotympanic branches arise from this segment. The lacerum (C3) segment of the ICA runs between where the carotid canal ends and the superior margin of the petrolingual ligament. This ligament runs between the lingula of the sphenoid bone and the petrous apex and is a continuation of the periosteum of the carotid canal. The cavernous (C4) segment begins at the superior margin of the petrolingual ligament, runs within the cavernous sinus, and ends at the proximal dural ring formed by the junction of the medial and inferior periosteum of the anterior clinoid process. Meningohypophyseal trunk, inferolateral trunk, and capsular arteries arise from this segment. The clinoid (C5) segment runs between the proximal dural ring and the distal dural ring where the ICA becomes intradural. This small segment has no branches. The ophthalmic (C6) segment begins at the distal dural ring ending proximal to the origin of the posterior communicating artery. Two major branches originate at this level, the ophthalmic 181 artery and the superior hypophyseal artery. The communicating (C7) segment begins proximal to the origin of the posterior communicating artery extending to the ICA bifurcation. This segment gives off the posterior communicating artery and the anterior choroidal artery.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "In this case, the right carotid is the one that has produced symptoms (side of her hemispheric stroke), and therefore if a right carotid stenosis is detected, it is considered symptomatic carotid disease. On the other hand, a left carotid stenosis in this case would be asymptomatic. Patients with extracranial ICA atherosclerotic disease can be treated medically or surgically to prevent cerebrovascular events. One of the most important factors when deciding if CEA will be beneficial is determination whether the stenosis is symptomatic or asymptomatic. Other patient characteristics should also be taken into account. According to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), in patients with 70% to 99% symptomatic carotid stenosis, the 2-year ipsilateral stroke rate was 26% with medical treatment versus 9% with CEA. Therefore, a 182 symptomatic carotid stenosis of 70% to 99% should be revascularized. Patients with symptomatic stenosis of 50% to 69% may also benefit from CEA, with greater impact in men versus women, in those with previous strokes versus TIAs, and with hemispheric versus retinal symptoms. In patients with stenosis of less than 50%, there is no evidence to support that surgical treatment is better than medical therapy. The same applies for carotid occlusions, in which the treatment should be medical management. Regarding asymptomatic carotid disease, CEA has proven benefits over medical treatment in patients with more than 60% stenosis as demonstrated in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS), and in the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST), however, the numbers needed to treat were high, and the benefit may not be significant in the real world, depending also on the experience of the surgeon. In ACAS, the absolute risk reduction was 1.2% per year with a number needed to treat of 85 favoring the surgical group. In the ACST, the absolute risk reduction was 1.1% with a number needed to treat of 93 favoring surgery over medical therapy. Carotid angioplasty and stenting has evolved in the last decade, and may be comparable to CEA for stroke prevention (see question 73 for further discussion). Medical management has also evolved significantly since the time of the carotid endarterectomy trials, and the benefit of surgery over medical therapy may be different with current medical therapy. However, comparison of current optimal medical therapy with revascularization has not been evaluated in a modern randomized controlled trial. Brott TG, Brown RD, Meyer FB, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient had a TIA, which is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction caused by ischemia without cerebral infarction. It is important to recognize TIAs and evaluate them, since patients who have TIAs are at higher risk of stroke. Around 10% to 15% of patients who suffer a TIA will have a stroke within 3 months, and the risk is higher soon after the TIA, with 50% of the strokes occurring within 48 hours. Therefore, patients presenting with TIAs should be urgently assessed, with a detailed analysis of their risk factors for stroke. Work up should be obtained to evaluate the vascular origin of the symptoms, to exclude alternative nonischemic causes, and to assess prognostic factors. The current proposed definition of TIA is based on lack of tissue damage and the absence of infarcted tissue. Brain imaging with MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is helpful in detecting the presence of infarcted tissue, even in the absence of persistent symptoms. Guidelines recommend the following: • Neuroimaging within 24 hours, preferably an MRI with DWI • Noninvasive vascular imaging of the extracranial arteries • Noninvasive imaging of the intracranial vasculature if it is considered that this will alter management • Patients should be evaluated as soon as possible Given that in the acute presentation a TIA (when symptoms are still present) is undistinguishable from an acute stroke, all patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms should be assessed similarly, and considered candidates for intravenous tPA until proven contraindication is determined. No period of observation should be allowed in this setting, since on acute presentation these two spectrums of the disease cannot be differentiated. Easton JD, Saver JL, Albers GW, et al.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for approximately 10% of all strokes and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The most common cause of spontaneous ICH is hypertension which is responsible for 75% of cases, followed by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Hypertensive ICH commonly originates in deep subcortical structures such as the putamen, caudate, and thalamus, as well as in the pons, cerebellum, and periventricular deep white matter. This occurs from rupture of deep perforating arteries, which suffer changes caused by chronic hypertension, leading to lipohyalinosis, making these vessels susceptible to sudden closure (causing lacunar infarctions) or rupture (causing hemorrhage). Charcot Bouchard microaneurysms have been classically associated with hypertensive ICH; however, they are not found consistently and are described only in a small number of patients. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy results from the deposition of amyloid protein (congophilic material) in the media and adventitia of cerebral vessels, especially in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels. This process is associated with cortical and lobar hemorrhages, which may be recurrent. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is seen more commonly in the elderly, and MRI with gradient echo sequences can detect multiple microhemorrhages in the brain, helping to make the diagnosis. (see question 51 for further discussion on amyloid angiopathy). Anticoagulation can be associated with any type of hemorrhage; however, hypertension is a more common cause, and the most likely etiology in this case given the location. Patients on anticoagulation may have hemorrhages showing a fluid–fluid level. Intracranial aneurysmal rupture presents with SAH rather than intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Moyamoya is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy that affects the intracranial circulation, leading to arterial occlusions and prominent arterial collateral circulation. It presents most commonly in children and adolescents, with a second peak in the fourth decade of life, but with a much lower frequency. Clinical manifestations include TIAs and strokes, as well as intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs). In childhood the presentation is predominantly ischemic, with strokes and TIAs, which may be precipitated by hyperventilation. In adults, the presentation is most frequently ICH. Other manifestations seen in Moyamoya disease include headaches, seizures, movement disorders, and cognitive deterioration. The diagnosis is based on the angiographic findings, characterized by progressive bilateral stenosis of the distal internal carotid arteries, extending to proximal ACAs and MCAs, and the development of extensive collateral circulation at the base of the brain, with the “puff of smoke” appearance. Histopathologically, there is intimal thickening by fibrous tissue of the affected arteries, with no inflammatory cells or atheromas. There is no curative treatment for this condition. Revascularization procedures may improve perfusion, angiographic appearance, and ischemic manifestations; however, they may not impact the frequency of hemorrhagic events. Medications such as antiplatelets, vasodilators, calcium-channel blockers, and steroids have been used with equivocal results. Anticoagulation is not helpful and usually avoided given the hemorrhagic complications. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Amyloid angiopathy is a condition in which there is deposition of amyloid material in the cerebral vessels, especially in the cortex and leptomeninges, and is associated with lobar hemorrhages in the elderly. Since the angiopathy is diffuse, there are recurrent and multiple hemorrhages, and commonly MRI with gradient echo sequences will show multiple small areas of hypointensity suggesting prior hemosiderin deposition from prior microhemorrhages, such as in this case. Histologically, there is deposition of Congo-red positive amyloid material in the media and adventitia of small- and medium-sized vessels. This causes weakening of the vessel walls. There are associations of amyloid angiopathy with apolipoprotein E4 and E2, as well as with Alzheimer’s disease. Hypertension does not produce this pattern of microhemorrhages seen on gradient echo sequences. Intracranial aneurysmal rupture presents with SAH rather than intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

The V3 segment extends from the transverse foramen of C2 and turns posterolaterally around the arch of C1, between the atlas and the occiput. This segment is extracranial. The V4 segment begins where the vertebral artery enters the dura at the foramen magnum and joins the contralateral vertebral artery to form the basilar artery. The vertebral artery, at the V4 segment gives off the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the anterior spinal artery. Both vertebral arteries will join to form the basilar artery. The posterior circulation provides the vascular supply to the 188 brainstem, cerebellum, the thalamus, and the occipital lobes. Blumenfeld H. Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases. 1st ed.

      "explicacao": "Based on the history, risk factors, and MRI findings in Figure 2.15 , this patient most likely has a hemorrhagic infarct from venous sinus thrombosis, in this case, a left transverse sinus thrombosis. Occlusion of the venous sinuses will lead to venous infarction and localized edema. The affected tissue becomes engorged, swollen, and the parenchyma will suffer ischemia, leading to infarct and hemorrhage, which is also influenced by the impaired venous drainage. Given the occlusion of venous drainage and in the setting of parenchymal edema, the content of the intracranial volume will tend to rise, leading to intracranial hypertension. Clinical presentation is characterized by the presence of headache, and depending on the extent of the disease, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, seizures, and coma will be present, in severe cases progressing to herniation and death. Risk factors are often encountered including prothrombotic states, either genetic or acquired, such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, pregnancy, and the use of oral contraceptives. Other causes include infections (otitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis, meningitis), inflammatory conditions, trauma, dehydration, and neoplastic processes. The diagnosis should be considered in young patients with prothrombotic risk factors presenting with clinical manifestations suggestive of this condition. CT scan and MRI of the brain will show hemorrhagic infarcts that are not in a strictly arterial distribution (as in Figure 2.15 , in which the infarct seems to involve both the left MCA and PCA territories). MRV will demonstrate the absence of signal in the thrombosed venous sinus. Treatment involves stabilization of the patient and 189 anticoagulation to stop the thrombotic process. Treatment of intracranial hypertension may be needed, sometimes requiring surgical decompression. In some cases, endovascular intervention for thrombolysis and clot removal is required. This is not an arterial infarct since it does not follow the distribution of an arterial vascular territory. This patient does not have a history of hypertension, and the characteristics of the MRI are not typical of hypertensive hemorrhage. This patient is not in the age group for amyloid angiopathy–related intracranial hemorrhage, and the history suggests an alternative diagnosis such as venous sinus thrombosis.

In the setting of a recent event (within 30 days), should consider using clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 90 days in addition to aspirin. Other recommendations in this patient population include adequate blood pressure control (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg and <130 mm Hg in diabetics), high dose statin therapy to target LDL to <70 mg/dL, adequate glucose control in diabetics, and lifestyle modifications such as exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation. The Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial randomized patients with a recent TIA or stroke with a 50% to 99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery to warfarin or aspirin. The primary end point was ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or death from vascular causes other than stroke. At the end of the study, it was concluded that warfarin was associated with higher rates of adverse events and provided no benefit over aspirin in these patients. Antiplatelet agents have been the mainstay of therapy for this patient population, and aspirin was 190 the one assessed in the WASID trial. The SAMMPRIS (Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis) trial compared best medical therapy versus intracranial stenting in patients with intracranial stenosis (70% to 99% stenosis) and recent stroke or TIA, demonstrating that medical therapy is superior. The rate of early stroke was high in the stent group and lower than expected in the medical therapy group. Medical management in the study included aspirin 325 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 90 days, optimal management of risk factors (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg, and <130 mm Hg in diabetics, and target LDL <70 mg/dL), and lifestyle modifications. Based on this study, intracranial angioplasty and stenting is not recommended for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis given its periprocedural risk and high stroke rate when compared to low risk of stroke events on optimal medical therapy. For recurrent ischemic events despite medical therapy, angioplasty or angioplasty and stenting are not recommended and considered investigational. In the EC/IC bypass study, patients were randomized to medical therapy versus EC/IC bypass surgery, demonstrating higher rates of stroke in the bypass arm.

In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, an etiologic factor should be investigated, since it may be a treatable condition. Possible causes include oral contraceptives, pregnancy and puerperium, cancer, nephrotic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, connective tissue disorders, hematologic conditions, trauma, and genetic prothrombotic conditions such as protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation, and homocysteinemia. Infectious causes may also lead to thrombosis in nearby venous structures, and middle ear infections as well as mastoiditis have been associated with transverse sinus thrombosis. Diabetes and hypertension are typical risk factors for arterial strokes, but further search for prothrombotic risk factors should be done in cases of venous thrombosis. Since this is a venous thrombosis and not an arterial stroke, an embolic source does not need to be investigated, and therefore, an echocardiogram with bubble study and Holter monitor are not required. In venous sinus thrombosis, anticoagulation is important to stop the thrombotic process. In cerebral venous thrombosis, studies comparing anticoagulation with placebo have shown no increased 192 or new cerebral hemorrhages with anticoagulation, even in patients with pre-existing hemorrhagic infarcts. Endovascular thrombolysis with pharmacologic agents or mechanical thrombectomy can be performed but should be reserved for patients with severe neurologic impairment, stupor or coma and intracranial hypertension, including those with no improvement or worsening despite anticoagulation.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk for ischemic stroke; however, this population is heterogeneous and the risk may vary depending on several factors. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin or non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants is used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, especially when the stroke risk is high. However, very low–risk patients may not require anticoagulation therapy. This is one of the reasons why the estimation of stroke risk in atrial fibrillation is important. The CHADS 2 score is a simple score in which 1 point is assigned for the presence of each of the following: Congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, age of 75 years or older, diabetes mellitus. Two points are given for a history of stroke or TIA. The total score ranges from 0 to 6 and correlates with an expected stroke rate per 100 patient-years, with higher CHADS 2 scores correlating with higher stroke rates. CHADS 2 has limitations and does not include several commonly accepted stroke risk factors. The CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score includes risk factors that are omitted in the CHADS 2 score, has been validated in various independent cohorts, and currently recommended for risk stratification by the guidelines. In CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score, points are assigned as follows: Congestive heart failure (1 point), hypertension (1 point), age ≥75 years (2 points), diabetes mellitus (1 point), stroke/TIA/thromboembolism 193 (2 points), vascular disease (previous myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease or aortic plaque) (1 point), age 65 to 74 years (1 point), sex category (female) (1 point). The maximum score is 9 points. History of hyperlipidemia is not part of the stroke risk stratification score in patients with atrial fibrillation. Chronic kidney disease has been associated with increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, this risk factor has not been taken into account in the risk stratification scoring system. According to the guidelines, a patient with CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of 2 or more should be offered anticoagulation. In a patient with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score of 0, it is reasonable not to treat with anticoagulation. In a patient with a score of 1, based on individual characteristics, could consider either anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, or no antithrombotics. When starting a patient on oral anticoagulants, the risk of bleeding should be assessed carefully, and the decision to start anticoagulation or not should be made on each individual patient taking into account the risk of stroke and the risk of bleeding. HAS- BLED score has been used for the assessment of risk of hemorrhage. In the HAS-BLED score, 1 point is assigned each for hypertension, abnormal renal or liver function (1 point each), stroke, bleeding history or predisposition to bleeding, labile INRs, elderly (age >65 years), and drug use (1 point for antiplatelets or NSAIDs, and 1 point for excessive alcohol intake). A HAS-BLED score of >2 is considered high and associated with risk of major bleeding. However, a high HAS-BLED score should not be the reason to withhold oral anticoagulation, and treatment decisions regarding anticoagulation should be individualized. Lip GY, Lane DA.

      "explicacao": "194 In the brain, drainage of venous blood occurs through veins into dural venous sinuses, which eventually drain into the internal jugular veins. The dural venous sinuses are venous channels enclosed between dural layers, and they have no valves. The major venous sinuses are the superior sagittal sinus, the inferior sagittal sinus, the straight sinus, the transverse sinuses, sigmoid sinuses, and the cavernous sinuses ( Fig. 2.23 ). The superior sagittal sinus runs along the superior margin of the falx cerebri in the interhemispheric fissure, toward the confluence of the sinuses where it encounters the straight sinus and the transverse sinuses, which will continue as the sigmoid sinuses, draining into the internal jugular veins. The inferior sagittal sinus runs above the corpus callosum in the interhemispheric fissure, connecting with the vein of Galen to form the straight sinus. The deep venous system drains the periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamic regions and is composed of deep veins that drain toward the straight sinus. The internal cerebral vein is formed by the junction of the thalamostriate and septal veins, run posteriorly encountering the contralateral internal cerebral vein and emptying into the great cerebral vein of Galen. The basal vein of Rosenthal is a deep vein that drains the base of the forebrain, travels posteriorly between the midbrain and the temporal lobe on each side, and also empties into the great cerebral vein of Galen, located beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum. The great cerebral vein of Galen joins the inferior sagittal sinus forming the straight sinus, which will then run toward the confluence of the sinuses. 195 Figure 2.23 Venous sinuses. Illustration by David R. Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted with permission, Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography © 2015. All rights reserved. The cavernous sinuses are on both sides of the sella turcica and receive blood from facial and orbital structures, including the ophthalmic veins. The cavernous sinuses drain into the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The superior petrosal sinus connects the cavernous sinus with the transverse sinus on each side. The inferior petrosal sinus connects the cavernous sinus with the sigmoid sinus or the jugular bulb on each side, but this sinus may be hypoplastic or absent in some cases. The convexity of the brain has multiple superficial veins that drain into the superior sagittal sinus, the transverse sinus, or the middle cerebral vein, which runs along the Sylvian fissure. Between these structures there are anastomotic veins: the superior anastomotic vein of Trolard and the inferior anastomotic vein of Labbe. The vein of Trolard is a large anastomotic vein that connects the Sylvian vein to the superior sagittal sinus. The vein of Labbe is a large vein traveling over the temporal lobe convexity connecting the Sylvian vein to the transverse sinus. 196 Emissary veins connect scalp veins with the dural venous sinuses. It is important to note that the venous anatomy is highly variable, with reciprocal relationships, in which occasionally when one side or venous group is large, the contralateral or counterpart may be smaller and hypoplastic.

The diagnosis is confirmed with the histopathologic specimen shown in Figure 2.17 , demonstrating a blood vessel with a thick wall, which contains a basophilic granular material. This pathologic finding is characteristic of CADASIL. This condition is associated with a missense mutation in the gene NOTCH3 on chromosome 19. The gene product is a transmembrane receptor expressed mainly in vascular smooth muscle, and the mutation leads to accumulation of this protein in the vascular walls, especially in small arteries and capillaries. CADASIL is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and patients present with migraines with aura, stroke episodes, seizures, pseudobulbar palsy, and progressive cognitive decline leading to the development of dementia. The strokes are recurrent and predominantly lacunes, caused by small vessel disease. Some patients present with psychiatric manifestations, especially depression and emotional lability. Parkinsonism is not a typical 197 feature of CADASIL. The MRI typically shows T2 hyperintensities in the subcortical white matter and basal ganglia.

Intracranial vascular malformations include 198 arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), cavernous malformations, venous angiomas, capillary telangiectasias, and dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF). Cavernous malformations are clusters of vascular channels, composed of dilated thin-walled vessels, with no smooth muscle or elastic fibers, and with no intervening brain parenchyma separating the vascular structures. On MRI, they have the typical “popcorn- like” appearance, with a dark rim on T2 consistent with hemosiderin; gradient echo images (see Fig. 2.18 ) may show evidence of cavernous malformations when not evident on T2- weighted images. Cavernous malformations are typically incidental and found in asymptomatic patients; however, they may present with seizures and occasionally with hemorrhage, with manifestations depending on the location of the lesion. Hemorrhage from cavernous malformation is of lesser severity and lower pressure as compared to hemorrhage from AVMs. AVMs are congenital vascular lesions consisting of a tangle of dilated vessels (nidus) in which arteries and veins communicate without an intervening normal capillary bed in between. This lesion can be seen on CT, and CT angiogram (CTA) provides better vascular visualization. MRI demonstrates the vascular lesion with flow voids and regions of previous hemorrhage, as well as its relationship with the parenchyma. Catheter angiography is the gold standard diagnostic study to evaluate the vascular structure, pattern of vascular feeders, and drainage. AVMs present most commonly with intracerebral hemorrhage, with other typical presentations including seizures and headache. Dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) are acquired vascular lesions in which there is arteriovenous shunting typically supplied from meningeal or dural arterial branches, with drainage toward a dural venous sinus. These lesions are associated with increased venous pressure and arterialization of the draining veins. DAVF may present with pulsatile tinnitus, headaches, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits from increased venous pressure and abnormal vascular hemodynamics. Intracranial hemorrhage can also occur. Venous angiomas or developmental venous anomalies are thin- walled venous structures with normal intervening brain tissue. These are asymptomatic with a very low risk of hemorrhage. MRI 199 demonstrates a conglomerate of vessels in a “caput medusa” pattern. Capillary telangiectasias are abnormally dilated capillaries that are separated by normal brain tissue. They are typically found incidentally and rarely become symptomatic. Brown RD, Flemming KD, Meyer FB, et al. Natural history, evaluation, and management of intracranial vascular malformations.

      "explicacao": "The common carotid artery ascends in the neck and divides into external and internal carotid arteries, typically at the level of C4, below the angle of the jaw. The arterial supply to the brain is divided into two main territories, the anterior and the posterior circulation. The two internal carotid arteries provide blood flow to the anterior circulation, and the two vertebral arteries provide blood flow to the posterior circulation. There are three main arteries originating from the aortic arch, the innominate (brachiocephalic) artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery. Several normal variants exist in both the extracranial and the intracranial circulation; the most common anatomy is described below. The right common carotid artery arises from the innominate artery that originates from the aortic arch. The right common carotid artery bifurcates in the neck into the right internal and right external carotid arteries. The internal carotid arteries supply the intracranial anterior circulation. The right vertebral artery originates from the right subclavian 200 artery, which arises from the innominate artery. Intracranially the right vertebral artery joins the left vertebral artery to form the basilar artery. The left common carotid artery originates directly from the aortic arch, and divides into left internal and left external carotid arteries. A small percentage of the population have what is called a “bovine aortic arch,” in which the left common carotid has the same origin with the innominate artery, and in some cases the left common carotid will originate from the innominate artery. The left subclavian artery originates from the aortic arch. The left vertebral artery arises from the left subclavian artery and ascends in the neck to join the right vertebral artery intracranially, forming the basilar artery. Blumenfeld H.

      "explicacao": "This patient has a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), which is the most common type of spinal vascular malformation. This lesion is considered an acquired condition, and the arteriovenous shunting site is located within the dura mater near a spinal nerve root, where a radiculomeningeal artery connects with a radicular vein. This arterialization leads to increased venous pressure, venous congestion, and intramedullary edema, manifesting as a progressive myelopathy. DAVF is more frequently encountered in men and above 50 years of age. The typical location is in the lower thoracic and lumbar regions, and this type of lesion rarely produces hemorrhage. Patients present with pain, weakness, and sensory symptoms below the level of the lesion, as well as gait disturbance. The myelopathic syndrome is usually gradually progressive with occasional intermittent exacerbations and/or remissions. Some patients may have acute worsening of symptoms. MRI of the spine may show enlargement of the cord with hyperintensity on T2 seen over several levels, with perimedullary flow voids suggesting this 201 vascular abnormality (as shown in Figure 2.19 ). Spinal angiogram is the gold standard diagnostic test to detect this abnormality, and localize the level of the feeding artery. Treatment involves endovascular embolization with liquid embolic agents and/or surgical disconnection of the lesion. Surgical treatment has a higher success rate with low recurrence, as compared to endovascular embolization. A common approach is a combined treatment with endovascular embolization followed by surgical resection. The treatment goal is to stop the progression of the condition, and the prognosis depends on the degree of disability and duration of the symptoms prior to the treatment. The radiographic findings in this case demonstrate a lesion with T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord, with perimedullary flow voids. The clinical and imaging presentation are consistent with DAVF. Epidural hematoma and spinal cord infarct have a more acute presentation and would not have the MRI findings seen in this case. This is not a cavernous malformation or a venous angioma, which are not common in this location. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

The MRI can be helpful to estimate the timing of the hemorrhage on the basis of the characteristics of the blood and the composition. Initially hemorrhage is composed of plasma and red blood cells, with the presence of intracellular oxyhemoglobin, which is then converted to deoxyhemoglobin, subsequently oxidized to methemoglobin. Later, cell lysis occurs with the presence of extracellular hemoglobin, which is then converted to hemosiderin. Estimation of the timing of the hemorrhage is based on the 202 presence of these different types of blood products, and is as follows: • Hyperacute (<12 hours): The predominant blood product is oxyhemoglobin and is seen on MRI as isointense on T1 sequences, and hyperintense on T2 sequences. • Acute (12 hours to 2 days): Deoxyhemoglobin is the predominant blood product, seen as isointense on T1 and hypointense on T2. • Early subacute (2 to 7 days): Intracellular methemoglobin, seen as hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2. • Late subacute (8 days to 1 month): There is extracellular methemoglobin, seen as hyperintense on T1 and T2 sequences. • Chronic (>1 month, and probably for years): There is hemosiderin, seen as isointense or hypointense on T1, and hypointense on T2 sequences.

      "explicacao": "The clinical history, examination, and angiographic findings support the diagnosis of a direct carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF), in which a tear in the cavernous segment of the ICA allows arteriovenous shunting to the cavernous sinus, causing increased pressure within this sinus, with drainage toward a superior ophthalmic vein and impairing the venous drainage of the eye. External carotid artery feeders are not involved in the CCF of this patient. The abnormality in this patient is not consistent with a pial arteriovenous malformation. CCF is a connection between the arterial system (carotid artery) and the cavernous sinus. The symptoms are secondary to increased pressure within the cavernous sinus (with involvement of the cranial nerves traveling within this sinus and causing ophthalmoplegia), and increased pressure in the venous system draining the eye, impairing venous drainage (leading to chemosis, proptosis, increased intraocular pressure, retinal ischemia with vision loss). Increased intracranial pressure can occur, as well as increased intracranial venous pressure which can lead to intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (about 5% of patients). CCFs can be classified according to etiology (traumatic vs. spontaneous), hemodynamic factors (high flow vs. low flow) and 204 anatomic factors (direct vs. indirect). Traumatic CCFs are the most common, associated with head or facial trauma, and most frequent in young males. In general, most traumatic CCFs are direct and high flow. Spontaneous CCFs are typically encountered in older female patients, and may be caused by either feeders to from the ICA or external carotid artery to the cavernous sinus, or spontaneous tear within the cavernous ICA segment, occasionally from rupture of a cavernous ICA aneurysm. With direct CCFs the shunt is of high flow, causing an acute presentation with rapid progression of symptoms. Indirect CCFs are low flow, with insidious onset and gradual progression of symptoms. In indirect CCFs, the feeders may be from either the internal or the external carotid artery. Cerebral angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis, demonstrating arteriovenous shunting at the cavernous sinus, with drainage to the superior ophthalmic vein or to other venous structures. The goal of treatment is to occlude the fistula, and hopefully preserve flow in the internal carotid artery. Endovascular embolization is the treatment of choice, and can be performed transarterially through the tear in the ICA (in a direct fistula) or the feeders (in an indirect fistula), or transvenously using a transfemoral venous approach with navigation through the inferior petrosal sinus or the facial and superior ophthalmic veins to reach the cavernous sinus. Coils and liquid embolics are used through either endovascular route to occlude the shunting site. After successful embolization, chemosis and proptosis improve rapidly, and cranial nerve impairment may improve over days to weeks. Improvement of visual deficits depends on the duration and severity of pre-existing deficits prior to treatment. A last resort endovascular approach is the sacrifice of the involved internal carotid artery after making sure that the patient can tolerate permanent occlusion of this vessel. Surgical treatment is only indicated if endovascular approach is not possible or not successful, and may involve ligation of the involved carotid artery. Conservative management (external manual compression of the involved carotid artery at the neck several times per day for 4 to 6 weeks) may be useful in certain indirect CCFs, but is generally not 205 effective.

      "explicacao": "Dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) are acquired vascular lesions in which there is arteriovenous shunting supplied by meningeal or dural arterial branches, with drainage toward a dural venous sinus. This meningeal arterial supply (not pial arterial supply) as well as the absence of a parenchymal nidus distinguishes DAVFs from AVMs. DAVFs are associated with increased venous pressure and arterialization of the draining veins, and the etiopathogenesis may be related to a venous sinus occlusion (from venous sinus thrombosis, trauma, or previous craniotomy), leading to increased venous pressure and eventual formation of the arteriovenous shunt. DAVF may present with pulsatile tinnitus, headaches, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits from increased venous pressure and abnormal vascular hemodynamics. Intracranial hemorrhage can also occur. DAVFs have been classified according to the pattern of venous drainage, and the presence of cortical venous drainage is associated with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and nonhemorrhagic neurologic complications. According to the Borden classification: • Type I lesions have direct drainage from meningeal arteries to a dural venous sinus which has normal antegrade flow. These are the most benign. • Type II lesions have shunts between meningeal arteries and a dural venous sinus, with retrograde flow into subarachnoid or cortical veins. • Type III lesions have drainage from meningeal arteries to subarachnoid or cortical veins. Types II and III have cortical venous drainage, and are “aggressive” DAVFs associated with risk of neurologic symptoms 206 including hemorrhage. CTA and MRI/MRA may suggest the presence of a DAVF, by detecting abnormal flow voids, vascular dilatations, and/or cluster of vascular channels near a dural venous sinus. Cerebral angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis, and provides information on arterial supply and venous drainage. Endovascular embolization is the most widely used therapy for DAVFs, and can be performed transarterially or transvenously, typically with liquid embolic materials, with occasional adjunct use of coils. Given the efficacy of endovascular embolization, surgery is reserved for cases in which endovascular approach is not feasible or not successful. Gandhi D, Chen J, Pearl M, et al.

For patients presenting within 4.5 hours from the onset of symptoms and without contraindications, intravenous tPA should be given. For eligible patients, endovascular thrombectomy is indicated and associated with improved clinical outcomes. Prior to 2014 the available evidence did not demonstrate clinical benefit of endovascular thrombectomy. One study published in 2014 (MR CLEAN), and four studies published in 2015 (ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME and REVASCAT) demonstrated benefit of endovascular thrombectomy using stent-retriever devices in anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes presenting within 6 hours from the onset of symptoms, with significant improvement of clinical outcomes. Data beyond 6 hours from onset of symptoms is scarce at the time of the publication of this book. The majority of the patients in these studies received intravenous tPA prior to endovascular thrombectomy, and current recommendations indicate that waiting period should not take place after intravenous tPA to decide on endovascular treatment, and waiting may delay 207 reperfusion. Noninvasive vascular imaging is required to determine the presence of an intracranial large vessel occlusion as a target for endovascular thrombectomy. At the present time, the benefit of CT perfusion, MR perfusion, or other advanced imaging is unknown and not widely recommended. Based on available data, the guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke were updated in 2015, with the recommendation of endovascular therapy with a stent-retriever device in patients meeting the following criteria: • Modified Rankin score of 0 to 1 prior to the stroke • Acute ischemic stroke with intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours from onset • Occlusion causing the stroke involving the internal carotid artery or proximal MCA (M1 segment) • Age 18 or older • NIHSS score of 6 or higher • ASPECTS of 6 or higher • Treatment can be initiated within 6 hours from the onset of symptoms Even though the data is uncertain, it may be reasonable to consider endovascular thrombectomy for selected patients not meeting the listed criteria, including those who do not qualify for intravenous tPA, occlusion of other intracranial vessels (M2, M3, basilar artery, vertebral artery, posterior cerebral arteries), age <18 years, NIHSS <6 or ASPECTS <6. The use of other mechanical thrombectomy devices other than stent-retrievers may also be reasonable in some circumstances.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic 208 ischemic strokes. For decades, warfarin has been the only oral anticoagulant available for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are now available. In 2010, the FDA approved Dabigatran for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with subsequent approval of Rivaroxaban in 2011 and Apixaban in 2012. These non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants target the common coagulation pathway in specific factors, and have shown to be at least as efficacious as warfarin for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with lower risk of intracranial bleeding, without the need for monitorization of coagulation studies (no need to monitor INR) and without the multiple drug and food interactions that warfarin has. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), available as a prodrug which is metabolized to its active form. It has poor oral bioavailability, and the medication is coated with tartaric acid to improve absorption. Once absorbed, the peak level is reached in 1 to 2 hours and the half-life is 14 to 17 hours. The drug is 80% cleared renally, with the rest being metabolized in the liver. Therefore patients with low creatinine clearance require dose adjustments. In the RE-LY study, Dabigatran 110 mg twice a day was noninferior to warfarin for prevention of strokes and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with lower rates of major hemorrhage; and Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin with similar rates of major hemorrhage. This medication can however cause dyspepsia and may be associated with the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The FDA approved Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, with a 75 mg twice daily dose for patients with creatinine clearance of 15 to 30 mL/min. Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor which is easily absorbed preferably with food, with peak levels at 2 to 4 hours and half-life of 5 to 9 hours. It is 95% protein bound, allowing once daily dosing. Two-thirds are metabolized in the liver with one-third excreted unchanged in the urine. In ROCKET AF trial, Rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with similar risks of bleeding, but lower risks of intracranial and fatal hemorrhages. Rivaroxaban is administered in a dose of 20 mg once daily with a 209 meal, or 15 mg daily in case of creatinine clearance 15 to 50 mL/min. Apixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor, with peak levels at 3 to 4 hours, and half-life of 8 to 15 hours. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP450 3A4, and 25% is renally excreted. In ARISTOTLE trial, Apixaban 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Apixaban also was associated with lower risk of major bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage, and lower mortality rates. For Dabigatran, the reversal agent Idarucizumab has been approved. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds free and thrombin-bound Dabigatran neutralizing its activity. At the time this chapter was written there are no available specific reversal agents for Rivaroxaban and Apixaban. Most recent guidelines suggest that prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity or recombinant factor VIIa might be considered in individual cases with ICH secondary to these new agents. Activated charcoal can be considered within 2 hours of the intake of Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban or Apixaban. Hemodialysis has also been considered with Dabigatran. Aguilar MI, Kuo RS, Freeman WD.

      "explicacao": "Central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV) can be classified into two main categories, (1) primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), and (2) secondary CNSV. Secondary CNSV includes: (a) idiopathic systemic vasculitides, (b) systemic vasculitides associated with autoimmune diseases, and (c) systemic vasculitis secondary to nonautoimmune conditions, such as infections, drugs, or cancer. When evaluating a patient with vasculitis involving the central nervous system it is important to exclude secondary causes, 210 since the treatment may be completely different, including antibiotic therapy for infections, disease modifying agents or chemotherapy for systemic inflammatory conditions or cancer, and as simple as removing an offending drug in drug induced vasculitis. It is also important to evaluate for mimics, in which there is no inflammation but the vessels may appear abnormal on angiographic studies. Mimics include atherosclerosis or conditions such as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), CADASIL, and antiphospholipid syndrome. PACNS is an inflammation of small- and medium-sized parenchymal and leptomeningeal arteries involving the brain and/or spinal cord. It is present similarly in males and females, with presentation at a median age of 50 years. Headache is the most common symptom, usually insidious and/or chronic; however, thunderclap headache is very rare in PACNS, distinguishing it from RCVS in which thunderclap headache is a classic presentation. Ischemic strokes and altered cognition are also common presentations in PACNS. The following three criteria have to be met to make the diagnosis of PACNS: 1. Acquired otherwise unexplained neurologic or psychiatric deficit 2. Classic angiographic or histopathologic features of CNS angiitis 3. No evidence of systemic vasculitis or any disorder that could mimic the angiographic or pathologic features A probable diagnosis is made in those with high probability cerebral angiogram with abnormal MRA and abnormal CSF analysis but without biopsy confirmation. A definite diagnosis requires biopsy confirmation of vessel wall inflammation. Three main histopathologic patterns have been found: Granulomatous angiitis of the CNS, lymphocytic PACNS, and necrotizing CNSV. CSF analysis is required in the work up of PACNS, showing abnormalities in the majority of cases, including elevated WBCs and protein. CSF is also important to exclude other diagnoses including infections and cancer. In RCVS the CSF is usually normal but may be slightly abnormal. 211 In PACNS, MRI of the brain may demonstrate ischemic infarcts, areas of gadolinium enhancement in the parenchyma or meninges, and nonspecific hyperintensities in the deep gray and white matter. Cerebral angiogram is helpful, demonstrating the characteristics “beading” which represents areas of narrowing and dilatation. However, cerebral angiogram is not the gold standard for diagnosis and the “beading” pattern is nonspecific, seen also in atherosclerosis, vasospasm and infectious or radiation vasculopathy. Similar angiographic findings are seen in RCVS; however, these resolve within 3 months. Brain biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PACNS, demonstrating vessel wall inflammation. However, the sensitivity of brain biopsy is low, and this could be secondary to various factors, including sampling error and frequent inability to obtain involved brain. The yield of the biopsy may increase by obtaining tissue from an identified lesion on MRI. Treatment of PACNS includes high-dose steroids with or without cyclophosphamide. Once remission is achieved, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil can be utilized for maintenance. The evidence to guide treatment is limited, and mostly based on retrospective observational data and expert opinion recommendations. John S, Hajj-Ali RA. CNS vasculitis.

RCVS has been found in association with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and it is possible that both overlap or represent different manifestations in the spectrum of the same condition. RCVS has also been associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia. RCVS can occur spontaneously, but precipitant factors are commonly associated with this condition, especially vasoactive drugs including amphetamines, cocaine, cold medicines with decongestants, triptans, ergot alkaloid derivatives, and other adrenergic and serotoninergic drugs. Patients also may report triggers such as strenuous activity, sexual activity, Valsalva, and/or stressful or emotional situations. Noninvasive or cerebral angiography may demonstrate “beading” pattern with areas of narrowing and dilatation representing vasoconstriction, which is typically dynamic and may change over the course of the illness. The diagnosis of RCVS is confirmed with the reversibility of these angiographic findings, which occur at some point within 12 weeks. These findings can be assessed and followed up with noninvasive imaging, including transcranial Doppler. CSF findings may be completely normal, or may demonstrate findings consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage, or slight elevations in protein and white blood cells, which resolve spontaneously. Brain biopsy is not indicated, and only obtained when suspecting central nervous system vasculitis. In RCVS the biopsy should not demonstrate vessel wall inflammation. The management of these patients is symptomatic, with supportive care as necessary. Vasodilators such as calcium-channel blockers and magnesium sulfate are typically used. Inciting factors and drugs should be avoided. Steroids are not indicated, and 213 actually have been reported to worsen the clinical course. Prognosis is good with complete resolution of symptoms; however, residual deficits may persist in cases of ischemic stroke or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Ducros A.

The patient depicted in question 1 has a brain tumor, a condition associated with vasogenic edema. There are three types of cerebral edema: vasogenic, cytotoxic, and interstitial. The patient depicted in question 1 has an acute onset of symptoms suggestive of increased ICP, and a CT scan of the brain showing hydrocephalus. Given the rapid progression of the symptoms, the patient most likely has an acute obstructive hydrocephalus, in which there is disturbance in the normal flow of CSF within the ventricular system and/or from the ventricles to the subarachnoid space. The type of edema seen in acute obstructive hydrocephalus is interstitial edema, as the CSF is forced by hydrostatic pressure to move from the ventricular spaces to the interstitium of the parenchyma. Transependymal edema is another term used for this type of edema. The patient depicted in question 1 has a brain tumor with surrounding vasogenic edema. Vasogenic edema is an extracellular 243 accumulation of fluid that is usually associated with a disruption in the blood–brain barrier, leading to the extravasation of fluid out of the intravascular space. Multiple factors play a role in extravasation of fluid, including hydrostatic forces, inflammatory mediators, and endothelial permeability, leading to the opening of the endothelial tight junctions and subsequent formation of the edema. Vasogenic edema is usually seen surrounding neoplastic lesions. In cytotoxic edema there is intracellular accumulation of fluid. This type of edema is most commonly seen in hypoxic-ischemic insult, in which there is a lack of energy to the cells, leading to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and subsequent failure of the Na+ K+ ATPase, causing an alteration in the selective permeability of cellular membranes. Cytotoxic edema may also be seen with alterations in systemic osmolality, leading to intracellular edema. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP. Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology. 10th ed.

      "explicacao": "Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have a very high mortality rate, and those who survive have a significant risk of cerebral and cognitive dysfunction caused by damage from the absence of blood flow. Therapeutic hypothermia has been associated with improved neurologic outcomes in unconscious survivors after cardiac arrest. The evidence supports the use of hypothermic therapy in cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation (VF), but is limited in the setting of non-VF rhythms, including pulseless electrical activity or in asystole. Management recommendations have been proposed for unconscious adult patients with return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when the initial rhythm is ventricular fibrillation. In these patients, the evidence demonstrates benefit of hypothermia targeting a temperature of 244 32° to 34°C for 12 to 24 hours. This therapy may also be beneficial for patients with other types of cardiac arrest, such as pulseless electrical activity or asystole; however, the existing data is not strong in these cases. Hypothermic therapy is not free of potential complications and is associated with coagulopathy, arrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, and risk of infections. Temperatures lower than 32°C may not provide additional benefit and may be harmful. Regarding higher temperature targets, a study comparing a target temperature of 33°C and 36°C in unconscious survivors after cardiac arrest irrespective of initial rhythm demonstrated no significant differences in these two groups, suggesting that temperature control up to 36°C may also be effective in these patients.

The mass effect compresses parasympathetic fibers that mediate miosis, resulting in mydriasis. A fixed dilated pupil localizes the side of the uncal herniation. These patients have impaired consciousness secondary to distortion of the ascending arousal system in the brainstem. Hemiparesis also occurs secondary to compromise of the corticospinal tract. Since the corticospinal tract has not decussated at the level of the midbrain, if the uncus compresses the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle, the patient will have a contralateral 245 hemiparesis. Occasionally, the uncal herniation will lead to displacement of the midbrain against the contralateral Kernohan’s notch, resulting in a contralateral compression of the corticospinal tract, and therefore an ipsilateral hemiparesis. Uncal herniation may also cause compression of the posterior cerebral artery in the tentorial notch, causing infarction in this territory. The other types of herniation syndromes do not cause an ipsilateral dilated pupil with contralateral hemiparesis, and posterior cerebral artery infarction. Posner JB, Saper CB, Schiff ND, et al.

      "explicacao": "Hypernatremia is not a cause of cerebral edema. There are different types of cerebral edema. In vasogenic edema there is an alteration of the blood–brain barrier with movement of water from the intravascular to the interstitial space, and accumulation of fluid in the extracellular space. In cytotoxic edema there is an alteration in the cellular membrane Na + K + ATPase pump causing the water to accumulate in the intracellular space. In hyponatremia, there is a decrease in the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid, and by osmotic gradient there is entry of water into the cells, especially when hyponatremia develops rapidly. On the other hand, in hypernatremia water moves from the intracellular space to the extracellular space. To that end, hypertonic saline and other hyperosmolar agents are used for the treatment of cerebral edema. Prolonged cardiac arrest leading to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is associated with diffuse cytotoxic edema, likely caused by the lack of energy supply and failure of the Na+ K+ ATPase pumps in cellular membranes.

      "explicacao": "An intraventricular catheter should be placed. The CT scan shown demonstrates hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage. To measure the ICP, a surgically placed device is required. In general, an ICP-measuring device may be used in patients with head injury and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 or less, if the following conditions are met: the patient has a condition leading to ICP elevation amenable to treatment; the ICP measurement will have an impact on the decisions made for the treatment of the patient; the benefits of the device outweigh the risks. If there is a need for ventricular CSF drainage, an intraventricular catheter is preferred. The patient in this case has hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage and needs an intraventricular catheter. This device is inserted through a burr hole, through brain parenchyma, and into the ventricular system, providing the capability to transduce the ICP and allowing the possibility of CSF drainage, which can help decrease the ICP. Intraventricular catheters have up to 6% risk of hemorrhage and up to 22% risk of infection. In the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage with hydrocephalus, an intraventricular catheter is indicated. Parenchymal devices are inserted into the brain parenchyma and provide pressure measurements. However, these do not allow CSF drainage and may be susceptible to pressure gradients across the parenchyma. Epidural devices are placed between the dura and the calvarium and have lower rates of hemorrhage and infection, but their accuracy is low. Subarachnoid bolts are placed through a burr hole and in communication with the subarachnoid space. Their placement may be easier and the risks of infection and hemorrhage are not as high as with intraventricular devices, however, the accuracy is not optimal, it does not allow CSF drainage, and the device tends to get occluded.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Hyperventilation is a short-lived therapy, and a rebound increase in the ICP may occur. This patient has increased ICP, which normally ranges between 5 and 15 mm Hg (7.5 to 20 cm H 2 O). Intracranial hypertension is deleterious since it produces a decrease in the cerebral perfusion pressure and therefore reduced cerebral blood flow, resulting in cerebral ischemia. The care of the patient with increased ICP includes general measures and specific interventions. The general measures are used in every patient and include head position (the head should be elevated above 30 degrees), maintenance of normothermia (avoid fever), glucose control, blood pressure control, adequate nutrition, and prevention of complications. Specific interventions to reduce ICP include hyperventilation, use of osmotic agents, use of hypertonic solutions, use of corticosteroids in select cases, CSF drainage, surgical decompression in select cases, and in refractory cases, barbiturate coma, pharmacologic paralysis, and hypothermia. Some of these therapies are controversial. Hyperventilation has a rapid effect; however, it lasts for 10 to 20 hours and subsequently a rebound phase with increased ICP may be seen. Hyperventilation produces a reduction in partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ), and this hypocapnia leads to cerebral vasoconstriction, reducing cerebral blood volume and therefore reducing ICP. This therapy should be used to target a reduction of pCO 2 by 10 mm Hg, and/or to a target of approximately 30 mm Hg, and should be reversed slowly. Hyperventilation does not act by changing the CSF osmolarity. Mannitol is an osmotic agent and acts by raising the serum osmolarity and producing an osmotic gradient, driving water from the interstitium to the intravascular compartment. It is usually given in boluses of 0.5 to 1.5 g/kg and not as a continuous infusion. While on this medication, serum osmolarity should be checked at regular intervals targeting a level no higher than 320 mOsm/L. Mannitol as an osmotic agent will also produce diuresis, and may also lead to hypotension and hypovolemia. It is associated 248 with depletion of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. If there is damage to the blood–brain barrier, mannitol can leak into the interstitium, worsening vasogenic edema. Suarez JI. Critical Care Neurology and Neurosurgery. 1st ed.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "Barbiturates decrease the ICP by reducing cerebral metabolic activity and thereby reducing cerebral blood flow and blood volume. Propofol is a commonly used sedative agent in the neurocritical care unit since it has a short half-life permitting prompt neurologic examinations soon after it is discontinued. It produces sedation within a few minutes, it has a drug effect that lasts between 5 and 10 minutes, and awakening may occur 10 to 15 minutes after discontinuation (depending on the baseline neurologic function). Propofol also has been shown to reduce the ICP in patients with normal intracranial dynamics and preserved cerebral perfusion pressure, which makes this attractive in the care of patients with increased ICP. Unfortunately, Propofol is not free of side effects, and a prominent hypotensive effect as well as respiratory depression are frequently encountered. Propofol infusion is recommended for patients on mechanical ventilation. Other complications include hypertriglyceridemia and infections. Propofol infusion syndrome is a lethal complication seen rarely, mainly in patients on high doses for long periods of time, and manifests with hypotension, bradycardia, lactic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, and rhabdomyolysis. Hypertonic saline reduces the ICP by drawing water out from brain cells via an osmotic gradient. It can be used as a continuous infusion targeting a serum sodium concentration of 150 mmol/L. Serum sodium concentration should be monitored closely during administration of hypertonic saline, and changes should occur very gradually. Barbiturates may be used when the ICP is elevated and refractory to other measures. These agents reduce the ICP by lowering cerebral metabolic activity, leading to a decrease in 249 cerebral blood flow and blood volume. Patients on barbiturate coma should have continuous EEG monitoring to titrate to burst suppression. Continuous β activity is seen with benzodiazepines and is not a treatment goal. Pentobarbital is the barbiturate of choice and is usually started with a bolus followed by a continuous infusion. Its discontinuation should be gradual. Unfortunately, barbiturate coma has multiple complications, including hypotension, myocardial depression, predisposition to infections, and hypothermia. Marino PL. The ICU Book. 4th ed.

Reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke either with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA) and/or intra- arterial therapies are indicated within the first few hours since the onset of symptoms, and when there is brain tissue at risk for ischemia. In this patient, a large portion of the brain tissue in the affected vascular territory has already infarcted, based on the fact that the CT scan shows hypodensity, and there is very little, if any, salvageable tissue in this vascular distribution. Therefore, reperfusion therapy should not be contemplated, since it will be of no benefit and may be associated with hemorrhagic transformation with worse clinical outcomes. Cerebral edema in ischemic stroke may start to develop within hours of stroke onset, with a peak of maximal swelling on days 2 to 5 poststroke. Malignant cerebral edema, which occurs in complete MCA infarctions, is associated with up to 80% mortality 251 with conservative therapy. It is most commonly seen in strokes with occlusions at the ICA terminus and most proximal (M1) segment of the MCA. Other predictors of malignant cerebral edema include high National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (greater than 15 in nondominant hemisphere infarcts, or greater than 20 in dominant hemisphere infarcts), early hypodensity of more than 50% of the MCA territory on CT, and younger age. The initial management of these patients is based on supportive care, along with tight control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and temperature. General measures for the treatment of increased ICP, such as hyperventilation, hypertonic saline, and mannitol, are also used. In the appropriate patient (see discussion in question 42), the plan for early hemicraniectomy (<48 hours from symptom onset) should be discussed soon with the family, since this intervention improves survival. Larger hemicraniectomies have a better outcome than more limited surgeries. In this patient, anticoagulation should not be used and may increase the risk of hemorrhage. An intraventricular catheter is not indicated, since there is no hydrocephalus or intraventricular blood on CT, and there are no clear indications for ICP measurement in this case (see question 6).

The diagnosis of PRES is usually based on neuroimaging demonstrating a characteristic pattern of vasogenic edema predominantly in the posterior cerebral region, especially in the occipital and parietal lobes (though more anterior areas can also be involved in PRES). Risk factors and causative factors associated with PRES include hypertension, renal failure, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive drugs (particularly cyclosporine), cancer chemotherapy, septic shock, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Hyperlipidemia is not associated with PRES. Clinical manifestations include headache, nausea, visual changes, focal neurologic symptoms, altered mental status, coma, and seizures. Most patients present with severe hypertension and some theories suggest that PRES is a manifestation in the spectrum of hypertensive encephalopathy. The pathophysiology is not well understood, but it is thought to be related to a disruption in autoregulation of the posterior circulation, which associated with hypertension and hyperperfusion may result in alteration of the blood–brain barrier and vasogenic edema. Endothelial injury and dysfunction also may play a role. The treatment of this condition consists of aggressive blood pressure control. Supportive care is part of the treatment, and many times these patients need intensive care observation. Treating the underlying condition and/or withdrawing the offending drug or etiologic factor is a central part of the treatment. Bartynski WS.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Sodium nitroprusside is a vasodilator that produces arterial and venous dilation and reduces blood pressure rapidly. It is used in a continuous infusion; while it is not the first line of treatment for hypertension, it may be indicated in severe hypertension. Sodium nitroprusside is rarely used nowadays, but its mechanism of action, contraindications, and potential side effects are important to 253 discuss. When sodium nitroprusside enters the circulation, nitric oxide and cyanide are produced. Nitrous oxide then acts through the guanylate cyclase pathway, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and producing vasodilation. The vasodilation occurs in both cerebral and systemic vessels, causing an increase in cerebral blood flow and volume, and increasing the ICP, which along with a decrease in the mean arterial pressures can compromise cerebral perfusion pressure. Therefore, sodium nitroprusside should be used cautiously in patients with increased ICP. With continuous and prolonged infusion of sodium nitroprusside, cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity can occur. Cyanide originates from the nitroprusside molecule and can be cleared by binding to methemoglobin, or when thiosulfate donates a sulfur group, transforming the cyanide into thiocyanate. Cyanide toxicity should be suspected when tachyphylaxis occurs. The accumulation of cyanide can be treated with sodium thiosulfate, which provides sulfur groups favoring the conversion to thiocyanate, which can be cleared by the kidneys. However, thiocyanate is also toxic. Risk of thiocyanate intoxication is increased in patients with renal disease; therefore, sodium nitroprusside should not be used in this patient population. Manifestations of thiocyanate toxicity include anxiety, confusion, pupillary constriction, tinnitus, hallucinations, and seizures. This intoxication can be treated with dialysis. Marino PL.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "The CT scan in Figure 3.6 shows a subdural hematoma, in which blood accumulates in the subdural space adopting a crescentic or concave shape over the cerebral convexity. The most common cause is trauma, by producing an acceleration force, thereby tearing and causing rupture of the cerebral surface bridging veins that drain into the dural venous sinuses. Patients usually present with headache, change in mental status, and focal neurologic deficits. Surgical evacuation is indicated if the subdural hematoma is more than 1 cm or if there is midline shift. If the subdural hematoma is small it may be observed without the need for surgical evacuation. Rupture of the middle meningeal artery (usually associated with skull fracture) causes an epidural hematoma, in which the CT scan shows a lenticular-shaped biconvex hyperdensity. Lipohyalinosis and Charcot–Bouchard aneurysms are seen in chronic hypertension and may be associated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Subdural hematomas are not caused by aneurysmal rupture; therefore, coiling or clipping of an aneurysm is not indicated in this case. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "The cause of the new symptoms in the patient depicted in question 16 is most likely vasospasm. Vasospasm causing ischemia and delayed infarcts is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive initial SAH. Vasospasm can occur between 3 and 15 days from the onset of the bleeding, with a peak between days 6 and 8. The pathophysiology is not well understood, but there is evidence to suggest an inflammatory basis. Symptoms of vasospasm include headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, and focal neurologic deficits. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography provides information by detecting the velocity of the flow in the intracranial vessels and should be performed daily to follow the trends of these velocities. CT angiogram and catheter angiogram are helpful in the diagnosis of vasospasm. Acute hydrocephalus, rebleeding, and vasospasm are complications of SAH. Acute hydrocephalus occurs from obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct associated with intraventricular extension of blood. Clinical manifestations include worsening headache, change in mental status, and coma. Treatment of hydrocephalus includes the placement of an intraventricular catheter. Rebleeding usually occurs early on, when the aneurysm has not been secured. If a hematoma forms, it can produce mass effect and lead to uncal herniation. Even though these are potential complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the timing and clinical presentation in this case suggest that vasospasm is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Diffuse axonal injury occurs from disruption of intracerebral axons and is caused by the effect of angular forces and shear injury, but not from direct contusion or penetrating trauma. Diffuse axonal injury is most commonly seen in severe head injuries, such as motor vehicle accidents, and in which the brain is subject to rotational or stretching forces within the confines of the skull, or in which the head suffers severe and rapid acceleration and deceleration. These patients tend to have alteration of consciousness or loss of consciousness, progress to coma, and if they survive, they may remain unconscious, in unresponsive wakefulness (see question 9), or severely disabled. In diffuse axonal injury there is widespread damage of axons involving cerebral hemispheres (gray–white junction), corpus callosum, brainstem, and cerebellum. Macroscopically, there are small hemorrhages in the corpus callosum, superior cerebellar peduncle, deep nuclei, and throughout the hemispheric white matter. Microscopically, there is evidence of swollen (“bulb like”), 257 disconnected and injured axons throughout the brain. These dystrophic axons are seen on hematoxylin–eosin after 18 to 24 hours of survival, but can be seen as early as 2 hours after the injury with beta-amyloid precursor protein immunostaining. At the time of the injury, the axons may not be transected, but the microtubules and neurofilaments may be disrupted, leading to axonal transport impairment, with subsequent swelling of the axons appearing as bulb like or balloon like, subsequently separating and becoming disconnected.

The reported scalp laceration in this patient indicates that the initial impact was in the left frontal region. As deceleration occurs, the frontal lobe strikes the frontal bone and the falx, leading to formation of a hematoma. The contrecoup also seen in this patient is the result of injury that occurs distant from the site of initial impact and is usually seen in the frontal or temporal lobes, as these are in close relationship with the frontal bone and the sphenoid ridge, respectively. With cerebral contusions there may be loss of consciousness and focal deficits, and subsequent rapid deterioration from mass effect.

This patient has a clinical presentation and CT scan findings of a SAH, which seems to be denser in the left Sylvian fissure, likely associated with rupture of a left MCA aneurysm, as seen in Figure 3.8 . The most common cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. Hypertension and smoking are the most important risk factors for aneurysmal SAH. Patients with family history of a first degree relative with subarachnoid hemorrhage are also at increased risk. Heavy alcohol use and cocaine use are other potential risk factors for this 261 condition. The diagnosis of SAH can be suspected based on a clinical presentation of sudden onset severe headache (thunderclap headache, the “worst headache of my life”), sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness. Altered mental status, coma, and focal neurologic findings may also occur. Whenever SAH is suspected, a brain CT should be performed, demonstrating the hemorrhage in more than 95% of the cases when the scan is performed within 48 hours. If the CT scan is negative, a lumbar puncture should be performed in order to detect blood in the subarachnoid space, evidenced by elevated RBC count and xanthochromia. A negative CT scan does not rule out SAH. Clinical and radiologic grading systems have been developed for SAH and include the Hunt and Hess Grading Scale, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Grading Scale, and the Fisher Scale. Hunt and Hess scale is a clinical grading scale widely used in practice, and characterized as follows: 1. Asymptomatic or minimal headache and slight nuchal rigidity; 2. Moderate–severe headache, nuchal rigidity, no neurologic deficit other than cranial nerve palsy; 3. Drowsiness, confusion, or mild focal neurologic deficit; 4. Stupor, moderate–severe hemiparesis, possible early decerebrate rigidity and vegetative disturbances; 5. Deep coma, decerebrate rigidity, moribund appearance. The World Federation of Neurological Surgeons Scale is a clinical scale based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the presence of neurologic deficits, and characterized as follows: 1. GCS of 15 with no motor deficit; 2. GCS 13–14 with no motor deficit; 3. GCS 13– 14 with motor deficit; 4. GCS 7–12 with or without motor deficit; 5. GCS 3–6 with or without motor deficit. The Fisher grading scale is also widely used, based on admission CT scan, and characterized according to the presence of blood: 1. No SAH on CT; 2. Diffuse or thin vertical layer of blood <1 mm thick; 3. Localized clot and/or vertical layer of blood ≥1 mm thick; 4. Intracerebral or intraventricular clots with diffuse or no SAH.

This condition is not limited to the pons and could affect other areas of the central nervous system. Because of the risk of CPM, the rate of correction of hyponatremia should be no more than 12 mEq/L per day, or 0.5 mEq/L per hour. Patients may develop CPM after rapid correction of hyponatremia, and the manifestations are evident within 3 to 10 days, with progressive paraparesis or quadriparesis, pseudobulbar palsy, dysphagia, dysarthria, and altered mental status. Progressive extension of the demyelination may lead to locked-in syndrome. Most patients who survive will have clinical disabilities. Pathologically, there is bilateral symmetric focal destruction of myelin in the ventral pons, sparing axons and neuronal cell bodies. The myelin disruption is not limited to the pons, and extrapontine myelinolysis has been observed in the cerebellum, thalamus, external and extreme capsules, basal ganglia, deep layers of the cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter, and sometimes even in the fornix, subthalamic nucleus, amygdala, optic tract, and spinal 263 cord. Other conditions associated with CPM are severe alcoholism, chronic liver disease and liver transplantation, and extensive burns. Aminoff MJ. Neurology and General Medicine. 4th ed.

Patients with myasthenia gravis taking excessive amounts of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine may be at risk for a cholinergic crisis (also discussed in Chapter 10 ). It is sometimes difficult to differentiate this from a true myasthenic crisis; when patients start experiencing symptoms of worsening myasthenia, they may increase the frequency and dose of their pyridostigmine, putting themselves at risk for a cholinergic crisis. The following include manifestations of a cholinergic crisis: small and even pinpoint pupils, excessive secretions, diarrhea, sweating, bradycardia, muscle weakness, and fasciculations. The symptoms will subside with cessation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The presence of pinpoint pupils and increased cholinergic activity suggest a cholinergic crisis and not a myasthenic crisis.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "In SAH, hypertensive therapy should be avoided until the culprit aneurysm is secured (clipped or coiled). The goals of therapy in SAH are initial stabilization, supportive care, prevention of complications such as rebleeding and vasospasm, and specific aneurysmal treatment. Patients who are comatose or cannot protect the airway should 264 be intubated. Blood pressure should be controlled, and hypertension should be avoided in the first few hours, and until the aneurysm has been secured (either by clipping or coiling). Intravenous isotonic fluids are aggressively administered, and hypotonic fluids should be avoided. Hyponatremia is a potential complication seen in SAH, either by cerebral salt wasting or SIADH. Prophylactic antiepileptic agents are given, since a generalized seizure may be catastrophic, especially in a patient with an unsecured aneurysm. Mild sedation should be generally provided, and pain control should be optimal. Nimodipine (not Nifedipine) is a calcium channel blocker that is utilized in a dose of 60 mg every 4 hours for 21 days following aneurysmal SAH and has been shown to improve outcomes from vasospasm. Pravastatin therapy has also been shown to improve outcomes and reduce delayed ischemic deficits from vasospasm. Specific aneurysmal treatment includes isolation of the aneurysm from the circulation, either by surgical clips or endovascular coils. Once the aneurysm is secured, blood pressure can be liberalized, and hypertensive therapy can be used in case of vasospasm. “Triple H therapy” has been recommended for the treatment of vasospasm, and it consists of hypervolemia, hypertension, and hemodilution. This is achieved by expanding the intravascular volume using isotonic fluids, and sometimes colloids such as albumin. Vasopressors can also be utilized. The risk of triple H therapy includes rebleeding from an unsecured aneurysm, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and cerebral edema. A systematic review of the various components of triple H therapy has suggested that inducing hypertension is more effective in increasing cerebral blood flow than hemodilution or hypervolemia. If vasospasm is refractory, endovascular therapies may play a role, including intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators such as nicardipine, or balloon angioplasty of the affected vessels. The use of external ventricular drain catheters is reserved for acute hydrocephalus, or intraventricular extension of blood (Fisher grade 4). Dankbaar JW, Slooter AJC, Rinkel GJE, et al.

      "explicacao": "Apneustic breathing pattern is seen in patients with pontine lesions (patients with pontine lesions have pinpoint pupils). Medullary lesions are associated with ataxic breathing. Breathing is a complex action that is integrated by circuits in the brainstem, with connections at different neural levels in the brain and upper cervical cord, and under the influence of chemical and mechanical input that enter via the vagus and the glossopharyngeal nerves. Respiratory rhythm is an intrinsic function of a group of neurons in the ventrolateral medulla, but under the control of a pontine cell group that integrates breathing with other functions, reflexes, and metabolic input. Apneusis is a respiratory pause at full inspiration and occurs from bilateral pontine lesions. In apneustic breathing, there is respiratory pause after inspiration alternating with end-expiratory pause. Since pinpoint pupils are seen in pontine lesions, it is most likely that this patient will have an apneustic breathing pattern, and likely decerebrate posture. Cheyne–Stokes respiration is a pattern of periodic breathing in which hyperpnea alternates with apnea and the depth of breathing increases and decreases gradually. It is seen in patients with forebrain impairment in the setting of intact brainstem respiratory reflexes, but it is also present in patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Hyperventilation may be seen in metabolic encephalopathies such as in uremia and hepatic encephalopathy, but has also been reported in patients with midbrain lesions. Ataxic breathing is an irregular respiratory pattern (gasping 266 respiration) seen with lesions damaging the respiratory rhythm generator in the upper medulla. Posner JB, Saper CB, Schiff ND, et al.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "A four-vessel angiogram should be performed in all cases of nontraumatic SAH. Subarachnoid hemorrhage should be suspected in patients presenting with sudden onset of severe headache (described as the “worst headache”). These patients may have nausea, vomiting, neck pain or stiffness, photophobia, alteration in the level of consciousness, and focal neurologic symptoms or deficits on examination. All patients with suspected SAH should have a brain CT scan, which will detect hemorrhage in 95% of the cases within 48 hours of the bleed. As days pass, the sensitivity of the CT will drop, being approximately 50% by day 7 posthemorrhage. If the CT does not show the hemorrhage, but there is high clinical suspicion, a lumbar puncture should be performed. CSF RBC count that does not decrease in subsequent tubes and the presence of xanthochromia are findings consistent with SAH. The appearance of xanthochromia requires the presence of RBCs in the CSF for some time; therefore, it may not be present in the first few hours following the hemorrhage. A lumbar puncture is not required in all cases, and actually is rarely performed if the CT scan shows the hemorrhage. The leading cause of nontraumatic SAH is rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. To determine the presence of aneurysm, a CT angiogram or MR angiogram can be performed; however, conventional cerebral angiography is the gold standard, and a four- vessel angiogram should be performed in all cases of nontraumatic SAH. CTA is very helpful for detecting intracranial aneurysms in acute SAH, with comparable sensitivity and specificity to a conventional cerebral angiography. Approximately 15% of the patients have multiple aneurysms in different territories. Brain MRI is not usually obtained in the acute setting, and may 267 be less sensitive for the detection of hemorrhage in acute SAH. However, brain MRI may be helpful in certain cases for evaluation of other lesions that may cause SAH, such as vascular malformations or thrombosed aneurysms. Suarez JI.

This patient has a massive intracranial hemorrhage, likely originating from the basal ganglia and extending to the ventricles. As in every patient who is in a critical condition, an initial survey should be performed, addressing the “ABC” (airway, breathing, circulation). Therefore, this patient should be intubated first in order to receive ventilatory support and maintain oxygenation. Second, hemodynamic support should be addressed, and in this case, blood pressure control is paramount. Recent guidelines recommend early intensive lowering of the blood pressure. For those patients presenting with hypertension with SBP <220 mm Hg, lowering the SBP to <140 mm Hg acutely is considered safe and could improve functional outcome. Fewer data is available for those presenting with SBP >220 mm Hg, however, the guidelines recommend that it is reasonable to consider aggressive blood pressure reduction in this group. Once the patient is stable from the ventilatory and hemodynamic standpoint, specific therapies to address his neurologic condition should be started, such as correction of coagulopathy if this is present, an external ventricular drain, and surgical decompression, if needed. It is important to always address the goals of therapy, code status, and end-of-life care with the family.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Prothrombin complex concentrates are associated with rapid correction of INR in patients on warfarin. Coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and the anticoagulant proteins C and S require γ-carboxylation in the liver for their activation, and this process requires the reduced form of vitamin K. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist. Warfarin is rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, highly bound to proteins, and metabolized in the liver. The use of this medication causes a prolongation in the prothrombin time (PT). However, to standardize the measure, the INR is used for this purpose. Patients presenting with warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage and a high INR need various therapies to reverse the anticoagulation and arrest the bleeding process. Administration of vitamin K is effective in reversing the effects of warfarin, but this requires new synthesis of coagulation factors, which takes time. There are oral, subcutaneous, and intravenous formulations of vitamin K. The intravenous route is preferred for urgent reversal of anticoagulation, with the rare risk of anaphylaxis. However, even with intravenous vitamin K, it may take between 6 hours and sometimes more than 24 hours to reverse the coagulopathy. Oral and subcutaneous formulations take even longer for coagulopathy reversal, and are not indicated in the setting of an emergency such as ICH related to warfarin. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) provides many coagulation factors, 269 including those depleted by warfarin, and is a relatively fast way to reverse coagulopathy from warfarin as compared to vitamin K. However, the use of FFP may result in delays from the process of compatibility testing and administration, and it may lead to fluid overload, allergic reactions, and transfusion-related complications. Furthermore, the reversal of anticoagulation from warfarin with FFP may be only transient. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are plasma derived factor concentrates which can provide high concentration of coagulation factors in small volumes, allowing for rapid administration and rapid normalization of the INR. PCCs correct warfarin-related coagulopathy faster than FFP. There are several formulations of PCCs with various concentrations of the required factors II, VII, IX, and X. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a procoagulant agent approved for bleeding complications in patients with hemophilia. It has been used in warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage, and the evidence suggest that it reduces hematoma expansion with rapid correction of the INR, however, its use has not been shown to improve mortality or functional outcome and this medication is associated with increased incidence of thromboembolic events, limiting its use. Protamine sulfate does not correct warfarin-related coagulopathy. Protamine sulfate is utilized to reverse anticoagulation due to heparin, and it plays no role in the treatment of warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage. In patients with ICH in the setting of warfarin, current guidelines recommend withholding warfarin, replacement of vitamin K dependent factors to correct the INR, and administration of intravenous vitamin K. FFP has been typically used. PCCs might be considered over FFP (if available) since they may provide more rapid correction of INR with fewer complications. Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for these patients. Newer oral anticoagulants including factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors are currently widely used for various indications. Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor for which the reversal agent idarucizumab has been recently approved. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds free 270 and thrombin-bound dabigatran neutralizing its activity. At the time this chapter was written there are no available specific reversal agents for the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban. Most recent guidelines suggest that PCCs, factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity or recombinant factor VIIa might be considered in individual cases with ICH secondary to these new agents. Activated charcoal can be considered within 2 hours of the intake of dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban. Hemodialysis has also been considered with dabigatran. Ansell J, Hirsh J, Hylek E, et al.

Indications for intubation in GBS include the following: clinical evidence of fatigue; severe oropharyngeal weakness; vital capacity less than 15 to 20 mL/kg, or less than 1 L, or a reduction of more than 30% from the baseline; maximal inspiratory pressure of less 271 than 30 cm H 2 O; maximal expiratory pressure of less than 40 cm H 2 O; hypoxemia with pO 2 of <70 mm Hg on room air.

It is a cause of failure to wean patients from ventilatory support. There are multiple risk factors for this condition, such as sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, use of neuromuscular blocking agents, use of steroids, poor nutrition, abnormal glucose levels, and low albumin levels. The patient depicted in this question was critically ill, septic, and received sedatives, paralytics, and steroids, all of which are risk factors for critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy. Patients can have isolated critical illness polyneuropathy or critical illness myopathy, however, it is not uncommon for these conditions to overlap. Critical illness polyneuropathy is an axonal sensory–motor polyneuropathy that affects the limbs and respiratory muscles. On nerve conduction studies there is reduction of CMAPs and SNAPs, with normal or mildly reduced conduction velocities. Histopathologically there may be findings of axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers, and denervation atrophy. Critical illness myopathy is a primary myopathy not secondary 272 to denervation. Electrophysiologic studies show SNAP >80% of the lower limit of normal and low amplitude CMAPs, as well as myopathic findings on needle EMG. Fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves are seen in both critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy. Histopathologically, in critical illness myopathy there is loss of thick myosin filaments and varying degrees of necrosis. The management of these conditions begins with the treatment of the underlying cause, and avoidance of risk factors. Adequate nutrition, physical therapy, and rehabilitation are necessary. Critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy may range from mild to severe forms, and can lead to severe disability after the resolution of the critical illness.

      "explicacao": "Status epilepticus is a neurologic emergency. Classically, it has been defined as seizures lasting more than 30 minutes, or recurrent seizures without recovery in between. This definition is outdated and may not be useful in clinical practice, since patients presenting with ongoing seizures should be treated rapidly without waiting for a 30-minute time limit. An operational definition has been proposed suggesting treatment of convulsive status epilepticus within 5 minutes of seizure onset. It is known that the efficacy of medications to stop the seizures decrease with seizure duration, so early treatment is mandatory. 273 The goal of treatment is to stabilize the patient, abolish the seizures, and treat the underlying cause. Initial therapy should always begin with “ABC” (airway, breathing, circulation). Benzodiazepines are the first line of therapy to stop ongoing seizures, and lorazepam is the most commonly used, based on its rapid onset of action, and preferred to diazepam based on its relative longer half-life. It is given intravenously at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg (2 to 4 mg). Following benzodiazepines, the second line of treatment is fosphenytoin (or phenytoin if fosphenytoin is not available), for which maximal effects peak at around 15 to 20 minutes. Fosphenytoin is preferred over phenytoin since it can be infused faster, with fewer infusion-related side effects and cardiovascular reactions. The usual loading dose is 20 mg/kg intravenously. If the patient continues seizing, a second dose of fosphenytoin (or phenytoin) can be given (5 to 10 mg/kg). Alternative second line medications have been used instead of phenytoin or fosphenytoin, and these include valproic acid (20 to 30 mg/kg intravenously), phenobarbital (20 mg/kg intravenously), levetiracetam (20 to 60 mg/kg intravenously), or lacosamide (200 to 400 mg intravenously). However, there are no class 1, blinded, head-to-head comparisons of these antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of status epilepticus. Data from clinical trials suggest that if one drug fails, successful termination of status epilepticus becomes subsequently difficult. Refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that does not terminate with benzodiazepines and second line antiepileptic drug. These patients should be intubated (if it has not already been done) and treated with propofol or midazolam infusion to control the seizures. If after continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam the patient continues to seize, barbiturate coma is the next step, usually with pentobarbital, with titration of the dose to burst suppression on the EEG.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "From the options listed, bilateral absence of the N20 response on somatosensory-evoked potentials with median nerve stimulation is the best predictor of outcome after cardiac arrest. A low percentage of patients survive after cardiac arrest, and of those who survive, a large number will have long-term cognitive and neurologic deficits. Prediction of outcome after cardiac arrest is important to guide treatment for these patients, as well as to provide useful information to the family. In general, the circumstances surrounding the cardiac arrest and CPR do not have good predictive value and should not be used alone for this purpose. Physical examination findings are helpful, and there is good predictive value for poor outcome if there is no pupillary response at 24 to 72 hours from the cardiac arrest, or no corneal reflexes and eye movements at 72 hours after the cardiac arrest. Before these time frames, the predictive values of physical examination findings are not accurate. Ancillary tests are useful in the prediction of outcome of patients after cardiac arrest. Brain edema on CT scan may occur, but its predictive value is poor for prognostication. EEG showing burst suppression or generalized suppression is associated with poor outcome. Somatosensory-evoked potentials with median nerve stimulation showing bilaterally absent N20 responses at days 1 to 3 accurately predict poor outcome. Certain biomarkers have been used, especially neuron-specific enolase, which, if elevated, will also help predict a poor outcome. Creatine kinase BB isoenzyme in the CSF can also be utilized; however the false-positive rate of this test limits its utility. Widjdicks EF, Hijdra A, Young GB, et al.

      "explicacao": "An apnea test with no respiratory movements observed in a patient 275 with a core body temperature of 31°C is not confirmatory of a diagnosis of brain death. A diagnosis of brain death should be made only in patients with normal or near-normal core temperature (>36°C). Death by neurologic criteria or brain death is defined as the irreversible cessation of function of the brain, including the brainstem. This diagnosis requires the presence of a catastrophic CNS condition leading to irreversible damage, examination findings of absent brainstem reflexes, and the presence of apnea on the apnea test. To perform the apnea test, the patient should be preoxygenated for 10 minutes with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 100%. A baseline arterial blood gas is obtained, and pCO 2 should be between 35 and 45 mm Hg. The patient is then disconnected from the ventilator but should receive oxygenation at a rate of 6 L/minute. The patient is then observed for 10 minutes for any chest or abdominal rise suggesting an inspiratory attempt. After this time, an arterial blood gas is obtained. If the patient had not demonstrated any respiratory movements and the pCO2 has risen to at least 60 mm Hg, then the test is positive, supporting a diagnosis of brain death. To perform the apnea test, the patient should not be hypotensive (systolic blood pressure should be 90 mm Hg or above), and the patient’s core temperature should be 36.5°C or above. The following is required for the diagnosis of brain death: • Absence of intoxication, neuromuscular blockade, pharmacologic sedation, or a medical condition that may obscure the clinical picture. • A normal or near-normal core body temperature (>36°C). • Systolic blood pressure of more than 90 mm Hg, or mean arterial pressure of more than 60 mm Hg. When in doubt, the following tests can be performed to confirm death by neurologic criteria: • Electroencephalography showing electrocerebral silence in a recording of at least 30 minutes. • Transcranial Doppler showing no flow signals, or abnormal 276 signals including oscillating flow or short and low amplitude spikes in systole without diastolic flow. • Nuclear medicine scan showing no isotope uptake in the brain parenchyma or no intracranial flow. • Angiography demonstrating no flow in the circle of Willis.

      "explicacao": "Decorticate rigidity is associated with hemispheric dysfunction or a lesion above the red nuclei resulting in disinhibition of the red nuclei, with facilitation of the rubrospinal tracts (which are thought to enhance flexor tone in the upper extremities). Decorticate posture is characterized by flexion of the upper extremities at the elbows and extension of the lower extremities, and is seen in lesions involving the forebrain down to the level of the rostral midbrain, and above the red nuclei. A decrease in activity of the rubrospinal tract will not be associated with decorticate posture. Decerebrate posture is characterized by extension and hyperpronation of the upper extremities with extension of the lower extremities. Decerebrate posture is caused by a lesion in the brainstem at or below the superior colliculi and the red nuclei, but above the vestibular nuclei. In decerebrate posture, the vestibular nuclei are intact, enhancing extensor tone, and without the influence from the red nuclei. Lesions below the vestibular nucleus will abolish a posture response, and are generally associated with flaccid limbs. Pinpoint pupils are seen in pontine lesions, below the red nucleus, and therefore not associated with decorticate posture. Blumenfeld H.

      "explicacao": "The CT of this patient demonstrates a subdural hematoma and a subfalcine herniation. In this type of herniation, the cingulate gyrus herniates under the falx cerebri. The pericallosal and callosomarginal arteries may be compressed against or herniate under the falx cerebri. According to the Monro–Kellie doctrine, a new mass within an intracranial compartment will expand at the expense of an existing component, and if the space available is not sufficient, compartmental pressure will increase, and a displacement may occur, causing herniation. Uncal herniation occurs from expansion of a lesion in a cerebral hemisphere, pushing the medial temporal lobe to herniate medially and downward over the tentorial edge. The medial temporal lobe will push against the midbrain and manifest with a fixed dilated pupil. Along with this finding, patients have altered level of consciousness, and a hemiparesis, which is most often contralateral; however, the hemiparesis may be ipsilateral if the temporal lobe pushes the midbrain against Kernohan’s notch on the contralateral side, therefore affecting the contralateral corticospinal tract. Uncal herniation may also produce a posterior cerebral artery compression resulting in an infarct in this territory. Central transtentorial herniation occurs from an expanding lesion in the diencephalon, leading to a downward displacement, which may put pressure on the midbrain. Tonsillar herniation occurs when the cerebellar tonsils are displaced through the foramen magnum, compressing the medulla and occluding the fourth ventricle outflow. A transcalvarial herniation occurs when a patient with brain edema undergoes hemicraniectomy, and brain tissue herniates through the skull defect. Posner JB, Saper CB, Schiff ND, et al.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "The relationship between intracranial volume and ICP is not linear. The adult brain is encased in a nonexpansible bony cavity that also contains blood and CSF. The intracranial volume, pressure, and cerebral blood flow are intimately related. The Monro–Kellie doctrine dictates that the volume in the intracranial cavity is constant, and an increase in the volume of any of the components of this cavity will produce a displacement of the other components. Initially, the system is compliant, with only small increases in the ICP as the volume increases. However, this compliance is limited, and as the volume continues to increase, the pressure will rise exponentially (not linearly). Cerebral blood flow is determined by multiple factors, including perfusion, mean arterial and intracranial pressures, as well as cerebral autoregulation and rheologic and metabolic factors. The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP, ideally >70 mm Hg, lower limit of 50 mm Hg) is obtained by subtracting the ICP (normal 5 to 15 mm Hg) from the mean arterial pressure (MAP) (CPP = MAP − ICP). Therefore, MAP and ICP are major determinants of perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow, and are targets for therapies in the neurocritical care unit. Vascular autoregulation permits optimal cerebral blood flow and is effective at MAP ranges between 60 and 150 mm Hg; however, this range is variable and may be altered in patients with chronic hypertension. Pressure responses and metabolic factors govern autoregulation by producing cerebral vasodilatation or vasoconstriction. CO 2 is an important factor, and increases in pCO 2 cause vasodilatation resulting in increased ICP. Blood rheologic factors are also important for cerebral blood flow. Lower hematocrit and lower blood viscosity are associated with increased cerebral blood flow. Bershad EM, Humphreis WE, Suarez JI. Intracranial hypertension. Semin Neurol. 2008;28:690–702. Suarez JI.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Larger and wider bone windows may be required for better clinical results as compared with smaller bone windows. In malignant cerebral edema, intracranial volume increases in the compartment of the infarcted tissue, and the ICP rises. Usual measures to reduce the ICP are frequently not enough, and herniation syndromes may occur. Decompressive hemicraniectomy involves removal of a large bone flap and opening of the dura, permitting the swollen tissue to herniate outward, thereby decreasing the ICP. A successful intervention requires a large and wide bone window with opening of the dura; otherwise compression of the swollen brain will occur at the borders of the opening. Several studies have shown the benefit of this intervention in terms of survival, with some controversy in terms of the functional outcome; however, better neurologic outcomes were seen in patients treated surgically. The age of the patient, timing of the surgery, and the hemispheric dominance are factors to take into account when making the decision to intervene. Patients older than 60 years of age have lower survival rates and poorer functional outcomes than those younger than 60 after this procedure. The optimal timing of surgery is unknown, but earlier hemicraniectomy is associated with better outcomes. Most decompressive hemicraniectomies are performed for nondominant hemispheric infarctions, and it is thought that functional outcome will be worse if performed for dominant hemispheres, since language has been already disrupted. However, patients with dominant hemispheric infarctions also benefit from this surgical procedure. All these aspects should be discussed clearly with the family, making sure that they understand that this surgery is a life-saving measure, with the potential of survival with significant disability.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "Status epilepticus is a neurologic emergency and should be treated as such. It is associated with mortality of approximately 20% in adults, with worse outcomes when seizures are more prolonged. Persistent and ongoing seizures lead to neuronal damage and pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic agents. Even though the pathophysiology is not well understood, several phenomena and mechanisms have been elucidated from animal studies. After seizure onset, in the first few milliseconds to seconds there is release of neurotransmitters, ion channel activity, and protein phosphorylation. This is followed by alterations in receptor trafficking with reduction of certain GABA inhibitory receptor subunits and increase in excitatory NMDA and AMPA receptors which occur in seconds to minutes. This contributes to resistance to benzodiazepines. In minutes to hours from the onset of the seizure there is alteration in neuropeptide expression of excitatory and inhibitory substances, leading to a hyperexcitable state. In days to weeks of ongoing seizures there are changes in gene expression contributing to epileptogenicity and neuronal damage. Rapid and early seizure control is necessary to avoid development of pharmacoresistance and neurologic damage. Regarding the etiology of status epilepticus, medication noncompliance in patients with epilepsy is a common cause. Other chronic etiologies include the late effects of previous injury or lesions such as previous stroke, previous traumatic brain injury or tumors. Acute symptomatic causes of status epilepticus are associated with higher mortality. Stroke is the most common cause of acute symptomatic status epilepticus in adults. Other causes of acute status epilepticus include metabolic disturbances, hypoxia, systemic or CNS infection, trauma, and drug effects. Febrile 281 seizures are not seen in adults, though fever can lower the seizure threshold in patients with epilepsy. Betjemann JP, Lowenstein DH. Status epilepticus in adults.

It is an autosomal dominant disorder, in which there is an excessive release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the skeletal muscle in response to halogenated inhaled anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants (more commonly succinylcholine). A mutation in 282 the ryanodine receptor gene has been found, and patients with central core disease (a myopathy resulting from a mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene) are at increased risk of malignant hyperthermia. Malignant hyperthermia presents with an initial rise in the end- tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) during anesthesia, muscle rigidity, increased body temperature, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability. Rhabdomyolysis occurs, leading to myoglobinuric renal failure. In patients developing malignant hyperthermia, the culprit anesthetics should be stopped and alternative anesthetics not associated with malignant hyperthermia should be used instead, ventilatory support and oxygenation should be optimized, intravenous fluids should be increased, and physical measures to reduce the temperature should be attempted. Dantrolene is a specific treatment that blocks release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and should be administered early on. This patient does not have a history of being on antipsychotics or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These are related to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and serotonin syndrome, respectively. NMS is similar to malignant hyperthermia and is characterized by increased body temperature, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. It is induced by antipsychotics, but other drugs that inhibit dopaminergic transmission may also be implicated. Management includes discontinuation of the antipsychotic and use of dantrolene and bromocriptine. The latter plays no role in the management of malignant hyperthermia. Serotonin syndrome starts abruptly and is characterized by mental status changes, hyperthermia, autonomic hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, clonus, and muscle rigidity.

Vasospasm resulting in ischemia and delayed infarcts is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive initial SAH. Vasospasm can occur between 3 and 15 days from the onset of the bleeding, with a peak between days 6 and 8. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography provides information by detecting increased velocity of the flow in the intracranial vessels and should be performed daily to follow the trends of these velocities. CT angiograms and catheter cerebral angiograms are helpful in the diagnosis of vasospasm. Catheter cerebral angiograms demonstrate luminal narrowing of the affected vessels with reduced distal flow. In this case, there is severe narrowing of the right M1 and M2 branches with reduced distal flow in the MCA distribution, and severe narrowing of the right A1, A2, and A3 branches. Segmental narrowing is also appreciated in the posterior cerebral artery supplied by the posterior communicating artery.

ICH score is the sum of points in five variables: Glasgow Coma Scale (2 points for GCS 3–4, 1 point for GCS 5–12, 0 points for GCS 13–15), ICH volume (1 point if ≥30 cc), Intraventricular hemorrhage (1 point), Infratentorial origin of the hemorrhage (1point), Age (1 point for ≥80 years of age). In the study performed to define the ICH score, this grading scale was an accurate predictor of 30-day mortality, and each additional point was associated with increase in 30-day mortality.

The diagnostic criteria for migraine require at least five headaches, each lasting 4 to 72 hours (unsuccessfully or not treated). It should be noted that in children and adolescents (aged <18 years), attacks may last 2 to 72 hours. Headache characterization includes unilateral location, throbbing/pulsating quality, moderate to severe intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity, and the diagnosis requires any two of those four features. Patients must have one or both of either nausea and/or vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia. Secondary causes or other diagnoses must also be excluded. Primary headache disorders are not associated with an underlying pathologic process and include migraine, tension-type, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania (PH), hemicrania continua (HC), and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing [SUNCT], short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms [SUNA])), and other primary headache disorders (primary cough headache, primary exercise headache, primary headache associated with sexual activity, primary thunderclap headache, cold–stimulus headache, external pressure headache, primary stabbing headache, nummular headache, hypnic headache, new daily persistent headache (NDPH)).

However, it is uncertain whether the trigger for cortical spreading depression occurs in the brainstem or within the cortex, or both. The theorized pathophysiology of migraine is as follows: 1. Activation of hypersensitive “central generator” (it is debated whether the initiating trigger for migraine occurs in the cortex or in the brainstem, or both). → 2. Disrupted ion homeostasis, release of neurochemicals, and transient neuronal dysfunction (cortical spreading depression). → 3. Meningeal blood vessel dilation and activation of trigeminovascular system. → 4. Release of vasoactive neuropeptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinins, prostaglandins, substance P, etc.) from activated trigeminal sensory nerves leads to sterile neurogenic inflammation. → 5. Worsening vasodilation, increasing firing of trigeminal afferents and further release of vasoactive neuropeptides causing pain intensification (the vasodilation itself is no longer felt to be the source of pain). → 6. Trigeminal nociceptive afferents carry pain signals to trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) for processing and ascent through thalamus to cortex. → 315 7. Continuous ascending pain signals activate more neurons, leading to associated symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting. → 8. Continuous TNC firing leads to central sensitization (allodynia) if activated pathways are not stopped (triptans have minimal to no effect at this stage; thus, the importance of early triptan administration).

      "explicacao": "In the scenario depicted in question 5, this patient should have a triptan prescribed for abortive treatment at migraine onset for future migraines, as well as preventative therapy. The abortive treatment could be combined with a non–steroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) for early treatment aimed at decreasing neurogenic sterile inflammation but is not needed now since her migraine has resolved. If she still had a severe headache, dihydroergotamine (DHE) infusion would be an option, but unnecessary at this time in question 5 because her headache is resolved, and it does not have a preventative role. It is crucial to treat migraine at the earliest symptoms identified. Optimal abortive treatment in the absence of vascular contraindications begins with a triptan. Concurrent administration of NSAIDs with the triptan decreases the neurogenic inflammation, the cause of worsening migraine symptoms. The purpose of the triptan is to reverse meningeal vasodilation, prevent release of vasogenic neuropeptides from the trigeminovascular system, and interfere with return of pain signals to the brainstem. The longer a patient waits to treat migraine, the less effective the acute treatments in 316 reversing the entire complex of symptoms. In addition, her headaches are severe, debilitating, occurring up to 12 days per month, and interfering with her job, so she should also be prescribed a preventative agent. Preventive therapy, if not previously started, should be initiated in migraine if the attacks are debilitating, severe (including presence of uncommon migraine findings, such as hemiplegic migraine, migraine with brainstem aura, and migrainous infarction), interfering with daily activities/jobs, and if there are greater than four migraines per month in general, although these numbers are patient-specific and variable. Preventive medication should be picked on the basis of comorbidities. In her case, she is overweight, so topiramate would be a reasonable choice because weight loss can be a side effect of this medication. Other examples would be a tricyclic antidepressant in depressed patients, β-blockers or calcium-channel blockers in hypertensive patients. In question 6, the patient now has had a migraine for more than 72 hours, so she is considered to be in status migrainosus and needs more aggressive therapy. The paresthesias represent cutaneous allodynia as a result of central sensitization related to the prolonged headache phase. Intravenous DHE infusion would be reasonable and safe at this point because she has not had a triptan within the last 24 hours. Other intravenous (IV) medications commonly infused with DHE for additional benefit include antiemetics, magnesium, ketorolac, valproate sodium, and steroids. Dihydroergotamine, steroids, promethazine, and ketorolac can all be administered intramuscularly in the absence of infusion capability. Inhaled DHE appears to be as effective as IV DHE with less side effects, although it is not available for clinical use at the time this edition is written. Raskin NH.

Agonism at 5-HT 1B receptors constricts the pain-producing intracranial, extracerebral blood vessels in the meninges. Agonism at 5-HT 1D receptors presynaptically inhibits trigeminal peptide release and interferes with central TNC nociceptive transduction and processing, whereas those of the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem are thought to inhibit nausea/vomiting. Ultimately, these effects result in reversal of vasodilation, decrease in neurogenic inflammation, reduction of central nociceptive signal transmission to the thalamus and cortex, and cessation of other ascending pathways to the cortex, which are associated with migrainous symptoms such as photophobia and phonophobia. Triptans come in various administration forms, including needle/needleless subcutaneous injectable (sumatriptan), nasal (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan), oral (sumatriptan, sumatriptan/naproxen, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan), and the most recent formulation, transdermal (sumatriptan iontophoretic transdermal patch that uses a mild electrical current to deliver sumatriptan through the skin).

Therefore, indomethacin should be the first medication tried in an “indomethacin trial.” In order to diagnose or exclude HC and PH, indomethacin should be used in a dose of ≥150 mg daily and increased up to 225 mg daily orally for at least a week (adequate trial generally requires up to 75 mg three times a day, but sometimes a higher dose is required), but for maintenance, smaller doses are often sufficient.

      "explicacao": "Headache red flags include systemic symptoms (fever, chills, and weight loss), history of prior cancer or immunodeficiency, focal neurologic signs or symptoms, new headache with onset to peak of seconds to minutes (thunderclap), “first or worst headache,” new- onset headache after age 50 years, precipitation by exertion, strain, or positional changes, increasing headache frequency and severity, and new-onset seizures. Secondary headache disorders have many possible etiologies and are related to an underlying pathologic process. They are associated with an abnormal neurologic examination and/or abnormal diagnostic workup. A family history of brain tumor is not considered a typical “red flag,” although certainly something to keep in mind as you evaluate the patient. A common mnemonic used for headache red flags is SNOOP: • S ystemic symptoms (fever, chills, and weight loss) or s econdary headache risk factors (HIV and cancer) • N eurologic symptoms or signs (confusion, impaired consciousness, and focal findings) • O lder: New-onset or progressive headache, especially >50 years of age (temporal arteritis) • O nset: Sudden, abrupt (thunderclap) • P rogression of headache (change in frequency, severity, or clinical features) Temporal arteritis (giant-cell arteritis) often presents in persons older than 50 years. It is associated with jaw claudication and headache usually localized to the temple region, although it may be nonlocalized. Constitutional symptoms are often present, such as fever and weight loss, and it is sometimes associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. The patient may also complain of visual disturbances, including visual loss or blurring. Patients with suspected temporal arteritis should have an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) checked. ESR is usually much greater than 50 to 60 mm/h in temporal arteritis. ESR should be checked in conjunction with C-reactive protein. ESR is often elevated 323 nonspecifically and is occasionally normal in cases of temporal arteritis. Diagnosis is confirmed by temporal artery biopsy. On suspicion of this diagnosis and particularly in the setting of ongoing visual disturbances, prednisone 60 to 80 mg daily should be started to prevent permanent visual loss, even before biopsy confirmation. The biopsy results can generally still be diagnostic if done within 2 weeks of beginning prednisone. It is also worth noting that this patient has a previous history of melanoma, which can recur and commonly metastasize to the brain. For that reason, MR image with and without contrast should be obtained (melanoma metastases are notoriously vascular).

The first-line treatment is carbamazepine, although the other choices have been reported as beneficial (except for lithium) if carbamazepine is contraindicated or ineffective. Hyponatremia is the most common side effect to monitor while on carbamazepine. If the patient is taking diuretics such as furosemide, the risk of hyponatremia will increase. Serum sodium levels should be monitored for the first few months of treatment. If a young woman presented with the 326 same symptoms, multiple sclerosis should be evaluated for, especially with bilateral trigeminal neuralgia, although Lyme’s disease, sarcoidosis, or other secondary etiologies should also be evaluated for in this setting. The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia requires at least three attacks of unilateral facial pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution (one or more divisions), with no radiation outside the boundaries of this territory. Characterization of the pain includes recurrent attacks lasting a fraction of a second or up to 2 minutes, severe in intensity, shooting/electric shock-like/stabbing or sharp, and that could be precipitated by stimuli to the affected area. At least three of those four features are required, and there should be no focal neurologic deficit. Secondary causes or other diagnoses must be excluded. Hypoesthesia or hypoalgesia in the affected trigeminal region suggests axonal damage and trigeminal neuropathy, warranting further diagnostic workup to exclude an etiology.

      "explicacao": "This patient is describing episodes of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). This is a rare primary headache disorder, which is classified as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia. It is more common in males and can easily be confused with trigeminal neuralgia or one of the other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. There are two types of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks. One is short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) 327 and the other is short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA). Trigeminal neuralgia does not have associated autonomic features and is discussed in questions 22 to 26. Following a painful paroxysm in trigeminal neuralgia, there is usually a refractory period during which pain cannot be triggered, whereas this refractory period is not seen in SUNCT or SUNA. The diagnosis of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (which include SUNCT and SUNA) requires at least 20 attacks of moderate to severe unilateral head pain in the temporal, orbital, supraorbital, and/or other trigeminal distribution. The duration of the pain ranges from 1 to 600 seconds and may occur as single or series of stabs. The attacks must have a frequency of at least once daily for more than 50% of the time when the disorder is active; however, the attacks generally occur in a very high daily frequency when active. At least one autonomic sign or symptom on the side of the headache is required to make the diagnosis, including conjunctival injection, lacrimation, facial sweating or flushing, rhinorrhea, congestion, sense of ear fullness, partial Horner’s syndrome (ptosis and/or miosis), or eyelid edema. Symptoms should not be attributable to another disorder. The difference between SUNA and SUNCT is that SUNCT requires both conjunctival injection and lacrimation, whereas SUNA requires only one or neither of conjunctival injection and lacrimation. SUNCT and SUNA are rare enough that an MR image without and with contrast should be obtained to rule out secondary causes, especially pituitary tumors or posterior fossa structural abnormalities.

      "explicacao": "It is very unlikely that this patient’s headaches are related to her 328 Chiari I malformation. When headaches are related to Chiari malformation, it is due to compression of neural tissue and alteration of CSF dynamics. The headaches are usually in the occipital region and precipitated paroxysmally by cough, bending forward, and Valsalva maneuvers. When symptomatic, there are other findings of brainstem compression or cervical cord compression, such as ataxia, visual disturbances, hoarseness, dysphagia, vertigo, nystagmus, hearing loss, and cervical myelopathy. Chiari is defined as tonsillar herniation below the level of foramen magnum, and it may be associated with syringomyelia (50% to 70%) and hydrocephalus. To make the diagnosis of a headache secondary to a Chiari malformation type I, this finding should be demonstrated on imaging, and there must be evidence of a direct relationship based on the following features: The headache must have developed in temporal relation to the CM1, and/or the headache resolves within 3 months after treatment of the CM1. The headache is precipitated by a Valsalva-like maneuver such as coughing, and/or has an occipital or suboccipital location, and/or the headache lasts for <5 minutes. The headache is associated with symptoms and/or findings of neurologic impairment such cranial nerve, brainstem, cerebellar, and/or cervical spinal cord dysfunction. Other causes or diagnoses must be excluded. Chiari malformations are classified into four types. Type I involves only extension of the cerebellar tonsils into the foramen magnum. This is the most common and typically found incidentally during an examination for another condition. It is also the only type that can be acquired. Type II involves extension of both cerebellar and brainstem tissues into the foramen magnum. The cerebellar vermis may be incomplete or absent. It is usually accompanied by a myelomeningocele, which is a form of spina bifida resulting from incomplete closure of the spinal canal and overlying vertebrae, causing the spinal cord and meninges to protrude through a sac-like opening in the back, most commonly in the lumbar region, and usually results in partial or complete paralysis of the area below that level. The term Arnold-Chiari malformation is specific to type II malformations. Type III involves herniation of the cerebellum and the brainstem through the 329 foramen magnum and into the spinal cord and is associated with severe neurologic deficits. Part of the fourth ventricle may also protrude through. Rarely, the herniated cerebellar tissue and meninges are present in an occipital encephalocele protruding from the back of the head or the neck. Type IV is rare, involves an incomplete cerebellum (cerebellar hypoplasia), and portions of the skull and spinal cord may be visible. In general, the upper limits of normal for tonsillar descent by age are as follows: 6 mm for ages 0 to 10 years, 5 mm for ages 10 to 30 years, 4 mm for ages 30 to 80 years, and 3 mm for ages older than 80 years. This patient has no neurologic features or symptoms consistent with a symptomatic Chiari, and her imaging is within the acceptable range for tonsillar descent. Her neck and shoulder musculature tenderness may be contributing to her tension-type headache, and physical therapy should be arranged. In addition, contributors such as stress, depression, and caffeine overuse should be assessed and addressed. She might benefit from preventive therapy at this time, and an antidepressant, such as amitriptyline, would be a reasonable consideration.

      "explicacao": "330 Although all of the mentioned options are included in the differential diagnosis, the history of trauma and especially a positional quality to the headache suggest traumatic CSF leak and subsequent low–CSF pressure headache, which is what this patient has. Some causes of low–CSF pressure headache include LP, neurosurgical procedures, dural tear from spondylosis, and meningeal diverticula. The most common location of spontaneous CSF leaks is at the level of the thoracic spine. An MR image of the brain with gadolinium will often show pachymeningeal enhancement (as seen in Fig. 4.1 ) and downward displacement of the brain and crowding of the posterior fossa due to the sagging and traction of intracranial structures and dura, which may mimic Chiari I malformation (as seen in Fig. 4.2 ). Neuroimaging may also reveal subdural hematomas or hygromas, engorgement of cerebral venous sinuses, pituitary enlargement, flattening of the optic chiasm, increased anteroposterior diameter of the brainstem, and decrease in the size of cisterns and ventricles. Historical diagnostic testing other than contrast-enhanced brain MRI includes low opening pressure on spinal tap, radioisotope (nuclear medicine) cisternography, and CT myelography. Cisternography is an outdated test and now infrequently used. It is significantly less sensitive than other imaging modalities. Heavily T2-weighted spinal MRI myelography with fat suppression (CSF leak protocol) has come into favor more recently since there is no invasive need to puncture the dura in order to inject a dye or tracer, which can potentially cause a CSF leak if not already present, and there is no need for contrast administration. Conservative treatment measures include bed rest, hydration, and caffeine. If these measures fail, an epidural blood patch should be performed, although it may take two or more attempts for complete relief. Surgical repair of the dural defect is done as a last resort. Headache attributed to low CSF pressure is clinically an orthostatic or positional headache associated with low CSF pressure (which could be spontaneous or secondary) or CSF leakage. This headache can present in conjunction with other symptoms such as neck pain, hearing changes, tinnitus, nausea, and/or photophobia. Treatment of the CSF leak and/or normalization of the pressure in 331 the CSF is associated with resolution of the headache. The orthostatic positional quality tends to be much more pronounced and immediate in postdural puncture headache as opposed to headache attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension, which also may improve upon lying supine, but may not necessarily resolve completely, although these observations are not absolute. The diagnosis of headache attributed to low CSF pressure requires the presence of low CSF pressure (<60 mm CSF) and/or imaging evidence of CSF leak. The headache should not be attributed to another cause or disorder, and it must have developed in temporal relationship to the CSF leak event or low CSF pressure or led to the discovery of low CSF pressure or leakage.

Frovatriptan has a half-life of around 26 hours and a slower onset of action than sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, and eletriptan. Any medication taken by mouth is a poor choice for acute treatment of cluster headache because cluster attacks peak very rapidly, so a fast onset of action is needed to abort the headache quickly. Triptans can be used, but the choice 332 would need to be a formulation with a rapid onset of action, such as sumatriptan subcutaneous injections, sumatriptan nasal spray, or zolmitriptan nasal spray. Sumatriptan subcutaneous needle-free drug delivery system may also be used. Oxygen is very effective as an abortive for cluster and is often used as a first-line treatment.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history suggests idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Benign intracranial hypertension and pseudotumor cerebri are older and previously used terms. The diagnosis of IIH requires the presence of elevated CSF pressure >250 mm CSF (measured by LP performed in the lateral decubitus position). It should be noted that an opening pressure of up to 280 mm CSF may be normal in some patients, especially in children; however, this level is considered elevated in most adults. Elevated opening pressure should be considered abnormal in obese patients since body mass index does not necessarily correlate with CSF pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid composition should be normal in IIH. Patients with IIH have a headache that has either been noted in temporal relation to IIH or led to its discovery, is aggravated in relationship to an increase in intracranial pressure, and/or is relieved by reducing it. Other secondary causes of the headache must also be excluded to make this diagnosis. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension occurs most commonly in young, overweight women. Most patients with IIH have a headache but not all. The headache itself does not have specific characteristics and is frequently described as retro-orbital, frontal, “pressure-like,” or explosive. They may complain of transient visual obscurations (seconds), graying of vision (especially with straining), diplopia from cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) palsy, bilateral pulsatile tinnitus, nausea, and vomiting. Examination findings may include those listed in question 40, especially papilledema (although this is sometimes absent), visual field loss, or decreased venous pulsations. Cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) palsy would not be an associated finding. The fundoscopic examination in this patient is consistent with papilledema. An early finding of increased intracranial pressure preceding papilledema is loss of spontaneous venous pulsations, although this can also be a normal variant. Disc margin splinter hemorrhages may be seen early also. Eventually, the disc becomes elevated, the cup is lost, and the disc margins become indistinct. 334 Blood vessels appear blurred as they course the disc. Engorgement of retinal veins leads to a hyperemic disc. As the edema progresses, the optic nerve head appears enlarged and may be associated with flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots as a result of nerve fiber infarction. The photograph does not show optic neuritis (see Chapter 1 ), anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (see Chapter 1 ), or posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (see Chapter 1 ). Of the possible etiologies listed, aqueductal stenosis is not a cause of IIH, although it would be a cause of hydrocephalus. Topiramate is used because of its carbonic anhydrase inhibitor effect; it decreases CSF production. Acetazolamide is the classic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used, unless the patient has a sulfa allergy, which would make topiramate a better choice. Treatment typically begins conservatively with measures such as weight loss, cessation of vitamin A (if toxicity is suspected), weaning steroids, and minimizing other potential risks. If there is no evidence of visual loss, some feel that treatment of the headache alone is sufficient. If there is evidence of visual loss, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide or topiramate should be started. Hydrochlorothiazide is not a typical treatment of IIH. Procedures should generally be considered when there is progressive visual field defect, visual acuity loss from papilledema, and intractable headache while on maximal pharmacotherapy. Optic nerve fenestration can be done if visual loss is progressive on pharmacotherapy. Serial high-volume LP is no longer recommended because of the short-lasting effect and unnecessary patient discomfort and inconvenience. Procedures performed as a last resort include lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Acheson JF, Green WT, Sanders MD.

Absent venous pulsations suggests elevated intracranial pressure, which can be the result of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to backflow pressure. Besides headache, other manifestations may include seizures, encephalopathy, focal neurologic findings, papilledema, and vomiting. Although a hypercoagulable panel should be checked, the more immediate testing should be a brain MRV and MRI to look for venous sinus 336 filling defects, occlusion, or abnormalities in the veins and parenchyma. If imaging confirms the diagnosis, IV heparin should be started with transition to warfarin. It is important to obtain the hypercoagulable workup prior to starting warfarin, because this medication may alter the results of these blood tests. Other risk factors for venous sinus thrombosis include oral contraceptive use (especially in conjunction with smoking), pregnancy, infection, head trauma, and malignancy. Treatment duration varies between 3 and 6 months, but if the hypercoagulable workup is abnormal, lifelong anticoagulation may be needed. Bousser MG, Russell RR. Cerebral venous thrombosis.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s presentation and history suggest hemiplegic migraine. Although there are sporadic forms, she likely falls into the category of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) given her mother’s history. There are three types of FHM that are all autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. FHM1 is linked to chromosome 19p13 ( CACNA1A gene), resulting in a defect in P/Q calcium-channel subunit. Additional FHM1 symptoms may include cerebellar involvement, such as gaze-evoked nystagmus or ataxia, also attacks of coma, prolonged hemiplegia, or both, but full recovery is the rule. Transient cerebral edema and cerebral atrophy are less commonly seen. FHM2 is linked to 1q23 ( ATP1A2 gene), resulting in a defect in the A1A2 sodium–potassium ATPase channel. Additional FHM2 symptoms may include recurrent coma, frequent and long-lasting hemiplegia, or seizures with mental retardation. Cerebellar ataxia is not associated with FHM2. FHM3 is linked to chromosome 2q24 ( SCN1A gene), resulting in defects of presynaptic and postsynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels. The diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine requires at least two attacks with an aura characterized by fully reversible motor 338 weakness and fully reversible sensory, visual and/or speech– language symptoms. Other diagnoses or causes should be excluded, especially conditions such as transient ischemic attack, seizure, and stroke. There must also be at least two of the following features: A headache that occurs with the aura or follows the aura within 60 minutes. One or more aura symptoms that spread over 5 minutes or more and/or two or more symptoms develop in succession. Each motor aura symptom lasts less than 72 hours, and nonmotor aura symptoms last between 5 and 60 minutes. At least one aura symptom has to be unilateral. In some patients, clinical motor weakness may last for weeks, although this duration is uncommon and not included in the diagnostic criteria. It should be noted that migraine is now viewed primarily as a neurologic disorder rather than a vascular disorder. Unfortunately, this outdated vascular theory of migraine is the basis for the ongoing contraindication to triptan and DHE use in migraine with brainstem aura (previously called basilar-type or basilar-artery migraine) and hemiplegic migraine, although multiple case reports have shown them to be safe.

Pseudotumor cerebri and benign intracranial hypertension are outdated terms for this disorder and should not used anymore. The other items listed are considered primary headache disorders. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is discussed in questions 35 to 40. New daily persistent headache is discussed in question 11. Hemicrania continua is discussed in questions 13 to 14. Hypnic headache is discussed in questions 59 to 60. Nummular headache is an uncommon primary headache disorder with pain of variable duration (reported anywhere from seconds to days), but most commonly chronic (75%), in a small well circumscribed area of the scalp without any underlying structural lesion. Patients also often complain of variable sensory disturbances and/or tenderness in the affected area. It was previously named “coin-shaped headache.” The diagnosis of nummular headache requires the presence of head pain felt exclusively in an area of the scalp in an intermittent or continuous fashion. The pain should be round or elliptical with a fixed shape and sharply contoured, measuring between 1 and 6 cm in diameter. There should be no underlying cause. In contrast to secondary headache disorders, primary headache disorders are not associated with an underlying pathologic process 340 and include migraine, tension-type, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (cluster headache, PH, HC, and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks [short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA)]), and other primary headache disorders (primary cough headache, primary exercise headache, primary headache associated with sexual activity, primary thunderclap headache, cold–stimulus headache, external pressure headache, primary stabbing headache, nummular headache, hypnic headache, and NDPH).

      "explicacao": "Motor weakness is not a symptom consistent with migraine with brainstem aura or any other form of migraine other than hemiplegic migraine. If there is presence of any motor weakness associated with attacks of migraine with aura (weakness should be unilateral if migrainous), it can be only hemiplegic migraine. Hemiplegic migraine was discussed in question 51. It should be noted that the terms basilar artery migraine, basilar migraine, and basilar-type migraine are older terms for what is now termed migraine with brainstem aura, and these older terms should no longer be used. This change reflects the fact that migraine is now viewed primarily as a neurologic disorder rather than a vascular disorder. Unfortunately, this outdated vascular theory of migraine is the basis for the ongoing contraindication to triptan and DHE use in migraine with brainstem aura and hemiplegic migraine, although multiple case reports have shown them to be safe. The terms complex migraine and atypical migraine should not be used and are not recognized terms in the most recent International Classification of Headache Disorders. Migraine with brainstem aura is a migraine with aura symptoms 341 referring to the brainstem, with no motor weakness. To make the diagnosis, there must be at least two attacks associated with fully reversible aura consisting of sensory, visual and/or speech/language symptoms, without motor or retinal symptoms. At least two brainstem symptoms must occur with the attack, and these may include decreased level of consciousness, diplopia, dysarthria, tinnitus, hypacusis, vertigo, and ataxia. At least two of the following features must also be present: A headache that occurs with the aura or follows the aura within 60 minutes. One or more aura symptoms that spread over 5 minutes or more and/or two or more symptoms develop in succession. Each aura symptom lasts between 5 and 60 minutes. At least one aura symptom has to be unilateral. Other diagnoses or causes should be excluded, especially conditions such as transient ischemic attack, seizure, and stroke.

      "explicacao": "Although this patient’s individual headaches would be consistent with migraine without aura, chronic migraine would be the most accurate diagnostic term based on her overall frequency of headaches. She describes no neurologic features, so this is not migraine with aura, and the other options are incorrect. Migraine was discussed in questions 1 to 2, tension-type headache was discussed in question 3, and cluster headache was discussed in question 18. It is estimated that the average annual incidence of new-onset chronic migraine in patients with episodic migraine is 2.5%. The diagnosis of chronic migraine requires that the headache is present on 15 or more days per month for more than 3 months. It must occur in a patient who has had at least five attacks fulfilling criteria for either migraine without aura and/or migraine with aura. Also, on 8 or more days per month for more than 3 months, the patient must have migraine with or without aura and/or believed to have migraine at the onset, relieved by a triptan or ergot derivative. Secondary causes must have been excluded. At the time this book was being written, the only FDA-approved treatment for prevention of chronic migraine was onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®). It was approved for this diagnosis in October 2010. Although the other listed medications are often tried clinically in both episodic and chronic migraine, they are not technically FDA approved for chronic migraine. The FDA-approved medications for prevention of episodic migraine in adults are topiramate, divalproex sodium, propranolol, and timolol. It should 343 be noted that in March 2014, topiramate became the first and the only (at the time this book was being written) FDA-approved preventive migraine medication in adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. The primary mechanism of action of onabotulinumtoxinA is by cleavage of the SNAP25 protein, which is a SNARE (Soluble N- ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein Receptor). The heavy chain portion of the onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin binds to the cell membrane of the motor nerve. After binding, it passes through the cell membrane of the motor nerve and into its cytoplasm via endocytosis, where the enzymatic light chain of the onabotulinumtoxinA is activated. Inside the motor nerve, the light chain of the onabotulinumtoxinA cleaves apart the SNAP25 protein, which normally enables vesicles storing acetylcholine to attach to the cell membrane. Cleaving the SNAP25 prevents these vesicles from fusing with the membrane and prevents the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction. Thus, nerve transmissions that normally trigger muscle contractions are blocked. This effect generally lasts for approximately 3 months. New nerve endings sprout and connect to the muscle after the original nerve ending is blocked, renewing the ability of the nerve to cause muscle contractions. Therefore, onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin does not permanently alter the neuromuscular junction. OnabotulinumtoxinA effect in chronic migraine may be related to the blockade of the release of neuropeptides involved in the transmission of pain (including substance P, glutamate, and CGRP), theoretically reducing pain sensitization of peripheral nerves. Topiramate has multiple mechanisms of action, including voltage-dependent sodium channel antagonism, enhancement of GABA activity through a nonbenzodiazepine site on GABA A receptors, and antagonism of AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors. Divalproex sodium primarily increases GABA effects and may inhibit glutamate/NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal excitation. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist, including at sites in the central nervous system. Notably, it is crucial when evaluating chronic migraine to exclude the presence of medication overuse headache (rebound headache), which frequently is found to be fueling the high 344 headache frequency.

Her neurologic examination is normal, she denies any other neurologic symptoms, and is asymptomatic in between headache attacks, which makes a structural etiology such as brain tumor less likely, although it should still be excluded. The diagnosis of hypnic headache requires the presence of recurrent attacks of headache developing only during sleep and causing the patient to wake up.

      "explicacao": "This patient has retinal migraine. It can often be difficult to differentiate between migraine with aura and retinal migraine, but if the visual disturbance is truly monocular, then retinal migraine is the diagnosis. The description of the visual disturbance (positive phenomenon, although negative phenomenon can also occur), the pattern and periodicity, young age, and the association of each event with a headache easily fitting migraine criteria make amaurosis fugax (would be negative visual phenomenon; vision loss such as the classic “lowering of a lamp shade”) very unlikely. Migraine was discussed in questions 1 to 2, cluster headache was discussed in question 18, and PH was discussed in questions 19 to 20. It is important to re-emphasize the point that rhinorrhea, lacrimation, sinus pressure, nasal congestion, and conjunctival injection frequently coexist with migraine and many other headache disorders such as the others listed due to trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) cross-activation of the parasympathetics via stimulation of the SSN of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).

      "explicacao": "Multiple studies including the Women’s Health Initiative Study have shown an association between women who have migraine with aura and increased stroke risk. In women younger than 45 years who have migraine with aura, there is a two-fold increased risk of stroke, although migraine without aura does not appear to have the same increased risk. This risk increases to six- fold with the use of oral contraceptives containing estrogen and nine-fold with the combination of smoking and oral contraceptive use. In women who have migraine with aura who are smokers, estrogen- containing contraception should be considered contraindicated. In women who have migraine with aura, but are not smokers, controversy exists regarding oral contraceptive use given the small but apparent increased risk of stroke. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the World Health Organization suggest that in women younger than 35 years who have migraine with aura and are nonsmokers, there is an acceptable lower risk of oral contraceptive use. However, if they are older than 35 years, the risk is unacceptably higher and oral contraceptive use is not recommended. According to the International Headache Society, in women who are either younger or older than 35 years, who have migraine with aura, and are nonsmokers, the decision for oral contraceptive use should be individualized by taking into account other risk factors. These would include uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, heart disease with concern for emboli such as atrial fibrillation, family history of 347 early heart disease at a young age (<45 years of age), obesity, systemic disease associated with increased stroke (connective tissue disease, sickle-cell disease, hypercoagulability), and so forth. In women with an increased risk of stroke, and especially with multiple vascular risk factors, nonestrogen methods of birth control are recommended, such as progesterone-only forms of contraception. An interesting study presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 65th Annual Meeting in San Diego in 2013 looked at almost 28,000 women older than 45 years who were followed up for 15 years. It reported that after high blood pressure, migraine with aura was the second strongest single predictor of heart attack and strokes. It came ahead of diabetes, current smoking, obesity, and family history of early heart disease. Migraine with aura predicted heart disease in women at an adjusted incidence rate of 8% versus an incidence rate of 10% for women with systolic blood pressure spiking at more than 180 mm Hg. This increased risk was not seen in migraine without aura. It is not necessarily thought that migraine with aura causes the stroke, but rather migraine with aura is a marker for young women at a greater risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the reasons for these associations are unclear and likely multifactorial. The combination of traditional vascular risk factors still shows the strongest contribution to cardiovascular disease, so risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes and high cholesterol should be optimized, especially in those with migraine with aura to reduce risk of heart disease or stroke.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Lamotrigine is the correct choice, although no antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy would be optimal. No AEDs are completely “safe” and risk-free. However, weighing the risk of harm to the mother and fetus from breakthrough seizures from no AED protection versus potential congenital adverse effects from the AED may favor the use of these medications during pregnancy in some cases. The prevalence of major congenital malformations in offspring 394 of women with epilepsy ranges from 4% to 10%. This corresponds to a two- to four-fold increase from the expected prevalence in the general population. The currently available data suggest that this increased risk can be attributed, at least in part, to exposure to AEDs. However, it should be noted that increased risk of congenital malformations (compared to the general population) has been demonstrated even in the offspring of women with epilepsy not taking any AEDs during pregnancy. Although robust long-term data are lacking, some of the newer AEDs, such as lamotrigine, appear to have a lower risk of teratogenesis and are felt to be safer than the other choices listed, all of which belong to the first (older) generation of AEDs. It is important to note that clearance of lamotrigine increases substantially during pregnancy, so the dose may have to be adjusted during this time and breakthrough seizures can occur. Data regarding congenital malformations related to AED exposure have been building over the past several years in relation to commonly prescribed AEDs including carbamazepine, valproate, and newer AEDs such as topiramate and lamotrigine. Interestingly, birth defect rates with carbamazepine monotherapy are lower than previously thought and some large studies report only marginally increased rates compared with different controls. Recent data also do not suggest adverse effects of carbamazepine on cognitive development. The prevalence of congenital malformations in association with lamotrigine appears to be similar to that of carbamazepine, and limited prospective studies on cognitive development do not indicate any adverse effects of lamotrigine. Malformation rates with valproate have consistently been two to three times higher than those with carbamazepine or lamotrigine. In addition, data suggest significant dose-dependent cognitive adverse events with the use of valproate. Of the choices listed, valproic acid has the highest risk. It is important to remember that the greatest risk for cleft lip and palate, neural tube malformations, and congenital heart defects is during the first trimester. The neural tube closes during the critical period of weeks 3 and 4. Preconceptional folate supplementation is recommended to decrease the risk of neural tube defects (see Chapter 14 ). A daily dose of 0.4 mg/d of folate supplementation is recommended for all 395 women of childbearing age, and a folate dose of up to 4 to 5 mg/d is recommended for all women with epilepsy taking AEDs.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "Gabapentin is neither an enzyme inducer nor inhibitor, so it has less potential interactions with other medications. It can be used as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. It is not used as monotherapy, given the availability of other more efficacious antiepileptic agents. Gabapentin can worsen generalized epilepsy, especially myoclonic epilepsy. The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is unknown. Its principal proposed mechanism of action, however, is through an interaction with the alpha2-δ subunit of presynaptic L- type voltage-regulated calcium channel. This subunit was recently identified as the specific binding site of gabapentin, as well as pregabalin, in the mammalian brain; binding of gabapentin and pregabalin may result in modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Gabapentin is absorbed by an active transporter in the intestine. When the transporter becomes saturated, the absorption of gabapentin becomes nonlinear (i.e., a smaller percentage is absorbed at higher doses). Notably, this is in contrast to pregabalin, which has a linear absorption and, thus, has higher bioavailability. Gabapentin is renally excreted, and essentially no metabolism occurs before excretion. The most common side effects 397 of gabapentin include fatigue, headache, nausea, dizziness, and ataxia. There are no significant drug interactions or idiosyncratic reactions. The other medications listed interact with the metabolism of various other drugs. Díaz RA, Sancho J, Serratosa J. Antiepileptic drug interactions. Neurologist. 2008;14:S55–S65."

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Supportive care is the general recommendation for the management of a simple febrile seizure (FS). It is estimated that about 3% to 5% of children aged 5 months to 5 years have simple FS. Ninety percent of these events occur in the first 3 years of life. One-third of patients have at least one additional seizure. Risk factors for having a simple FS include family history of FS, prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay, developmental delay, and day care. Incidence does not increase in proportion to increase in temperature. No risk factors are found in 50% of children with 398 an FS. The risk of afebrile epilepsy after FS is increased in children with developmental delay, abnormal neurologic examination, complex FS (defined later), and a family history of afebrile seizures. There is a <5% risk that patients with a simple FS will develop epilepsy. It is estimated that approximately 15% of patients with epilepsy have a history of FS. Simple FSs are characterized by the following: <15 minutes in duration, generalized seizure, lack of focality, normal neurologic examination, no persistent deficits, and negative family history for seizures. Complex FSs occur in approximately 20% of FSs and are characterized by the following: >15 minutes in duration, focal features, abnormal neurologic examination, seizure recurrence in <24 hours, and postictal signs (Todd’s paralysis), and are more likely to be due to meningitis, encephalitis, or an underlying seizure disorder. Prophylaxis is generally not needed but can be considered for recurrent or prolonged seizures, afebrile seizures, after complex FS, and with an abnormal neurologic examination and developmental delay. Chronic prophylaxis commonly includes phenobarbital and valproic acid, whereas short-term prophylaxis could include diazepam and antipyretics, though definitive data on the use of antipyretics for the prevention of FS are lacking. Furthermore, the potential toxicities associated with available antiepileptic agents outweigh the relatively minor risks associated with simple FS. After reviewing the potential risks and benefits of available effective therapies for short- and long-term prophylaxis, the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded (in its clinical practice guideline on long-term management of children with FS) that neither continuous nor intermittent anticonvulsant therapy is recommended for children with one or more simple FS.

The most frequently reported mutation is in SCN1A, which encodes the pore-forming α- subunit of the sodium channel and comprises four transmembrane domains. In contrast to febrile seizures (FS), which occur most commonly between 6 months and 5 years of age, the phenotype of “febrile seizures plus” includes patients in whom FSs continue past the defined upper limit of age. GEFS+ may also be associated with afebrile generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. One-third of patients have other seizure types as well. The pattern of inheritance is usually complex, although initial genetic discoveries first identified an autosomal dominant familial pattern. Mutations of a number of ion channel genes have been identified in GEFS+ kindreds. These include sodium channel (SCN) subunits ( SCN1A, SCN1B, and SCN2A ) and GABA A receptor subunit genes (GABRD and GABRG2). The result is increased sodium channel a ctivity or impaired GABA activity, ultimately leading to increased cortical hyperexcitability.

It has been postulated that antibodies to glutamate receptor-3 (GLUR3) may play a pathogenic role, although the available data are conflicting and the specificity of GLUR3 antibodies in the pathogenesis of Rasmussen’s encephalitis has been challenged. The focal cortical atrophy is progressive and eventually spreads to the surrounding cortical areas in the same hemisphere, and thus, the best treatment option for the patient’s intractable seizures is the surgical approach with hemispherectomy.

Fosphenytoin can be loaded at a faster rate, but because the fosphenytoin needs to be converted into phenytoin in plasma, the rate of rise of serum levels is approximately equal to that of phenytoin. Compared to phenytoin, fosphenytoin is not associated with purple glove syndrome; it can be given more rapidly intravenously, its administration is associated with a lower occurrence of cardiovascular side effects, such as hypotension, and it can be given intramuscularly. Purple glove syndrome may ensue when phenytoin infiltrates into the subcutaneous tissue, resulting in swelling, pain, and discoloration of the extremity because of blood vessel leakage. The most common side effects of IV fosphenytoin include pruritus, as well as the other less problematic and typical phenytoin side effects, such as dizziness, nystagmus, and drowsiness.

      "explicacao": "3-Hz spike and wave is characteristic for absence epilepsy. The other options are benign EEG patterns unassociated with seizures (also known as normal variants). Absence epilepsy has a peak age around 6 years and more often affects girls (70%). These patients are generally normal neurologically. Absence epilepsy is characterized by multiple daily spells lasting a few seconds. They begin and end abruptly and interrupt whatever activity is being carried out. During a seizure, there will often be a blank stare; automatisms such as lip smacking, nose rubbing, and picking at clothes may also be present, especially with longer episodes. These seizures are classically provoked by hypoglycemia and 403 hyperventilation. Mild ictal jerks of eyelids, eyes, and eyebrows may occur at the onset of the seizure. The thalamus is implicated in the generation and sustainment of absence epilepsy with the low- threshold (T-type) calcium channels of thalamic neurons playing a central role in thalamocortical interactions. First-line treatment includes ethosuximide (which acts via T-type calcium channel inhibition). Valproic acid, lamotrigine, topiramate, and zonisamide are also used. Notably, the use of lamotrigine has been associated with aggravation of absence seizures on rare occasions. In a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the efficacy, tolerability, and neuropsychological effects of ethosuximide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine were compared in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy. Ethosuximide and valproic acid were found to be more effective than lamotrigine. Notably, ethosuximide was also associated with fewer adverse attentional effects, and, therefore, it is considered to be the best choice for initial empirical monotherapy in children with absence epilepsy. Valproic acid and lamotrigine are often the drugs of choice when there are concurrent GTC and absence seizures. It is important to note that GABA B receptors promote activation of T-type calcium channels. Therefore, some GABAergic drugs can exacerbate absence seizures. Antiepileptic medications can often be discontinued as the child grows older, if the EEG is normal, and there have been no seizures for 1 to 2 years. Absence epilepsy carries a good prognosis. Eighty percent of children have remission through adolescence and at least 90% eventually have remission overall. Glauser TA, Cnaan A, Shinnar S, et al.

      "explicacao": "The EEG in Figure 5.2 reveals polyspikes in a patient with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and the history is also very suggestive of this disorder. Valproic acid is typically the first-line agent for JME. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is one of the idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Onset is typically between 8 and 24 years 406 (peaks in teens). Development is typically normal. Boys and girls seem to be equally affected. Myoclonic seizures constitute the most frequent seizure type. These are usually described as large- amplitude and bilateral simultaneous myoclonic jerks. Myoclonic seizures are predominantly seen on awakening, and the patient often complains about being “clumsy” in the morning and frequently dropping things. Falls are not infrequent. There is typically no loss of consciousness, although myoclonic seizures can occasionally be followed by a GTC seizure. Most patients have infrequent GTC seizures, which usually also occur on awakening. Some patients with JME also have typical absence seizures. The EEG reveals generalized 4- to 6-Hz polyspike and wave discharges interictally. Ictally, trains of spikes are seen, which are commonly triggered by photic stimulation (during EEG recordings). The first- line treatment is with valproic acid. Second-line treatments include lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, and zonisamide. Carbamazepine and phenytoin should be avoided because they may lead to worsening of myoclonic seizures, similar to the worsening of childhood absence epilepsy seen with these agents. Good control will generally require lifelong treatment and avoidance of triggers, such as alcohol intake and lack of sleep. Auvin S. Treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

      "explicacao": "The history and EEG in Figure 5.3 suggest benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood). The EEG classically reveals bilateral independent centrotemporal spikes on a normal background. The discharges on the two sides can either be independent or synchronized. They may 407 extend beyond the centrotemporal regions. Although the spikes on the EEG appear in the centrotemporal area, the temporal lobe is not the generator of these spikes. Rather, they are felt to be generated in the base of the rolandic fissure. Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood) is fairly common and accounts for about 25% of childhood seizures. Onset is usually between 2 and 13 years of age, and the condition typically resolves in the mid- teenage years. Seizures are characterized by focal motor, sensory, or autonomic manifestations involving predominantly the face, mouth, throat, or extremities, although secondary generalization can occur. These are seizures that classically occur nocturnally (70% only in sleep, 15% only awake, and 15% both). The EEG is characterized by the presence of independent bilateral, repetitive, broad, centrotemporal interictal EEG spikes on a normal background. The discharges are thought to arise from the vicinity of the precentral and postcentral gyri in the lower suprasylvian region. The characteristic EEG spike pattern is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Normal development, physical examination, and brain imaging are the rule, though there are exceptions. Seizures respond well to certain antiepileptic medication and carbamazepine is usually considered the first line of therapy in the United States. It is important to note that it is often not necessary to treat with AEDs unless seizures are prolonged or frequent; some advocate waiting for two or more seizures to occur before initiating treatment. If antiepileptic medications are started, they can generally be stopped after adolescence. (Only 10% continue to have seizures 5 years after onset.) Bouma PA, Bovenkerk AC, Westendorp RG, et al.

Hypsarrhythmia is characterized by abnormal interictal high- amplitude slow waves on a background of irregular multifocal spikes. These waves and spikes have no consistent pattern or rhythm and vary in duration and size, resulting in a chaotic- appearing EEG record. Hypsarrhythmia disappears ictally during a cluster of spasms and/or REM sleep. Infantile spasms occur during the first year of life (typically 3 to 8 months) and are discussed further in question 45. They are characterized by sudden tonic extension or flexion of limbs and axial body, often occurring in clusters, and especially shortly after awakening. West’s syndrome is a triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and psychomotor arrest or regression. This disorder often occurs because of pre/peri/postnatal insults, tuberous sclerosis, cerebral dysgenesis, and others. Treatment with ACTH is generally first line. Other treatments include corticosteroids, vigabatrin, clonazepam, levetiracetam, topiramate, pyridoxine, and valproic acid. Vigabatrin has been associated with retinal toxicity.

      "explicacao": "Phenytoin is used for the treatment of partial and/or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (primary or secondary). Its primary mechanism of action is inhibition of voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels. It undergoes predominantly liver metabolism, although there is also minimal renal metabolism. Patients who are in low serum protein disease states (such as liver failure, etc.) need to be followed with free phenytoin levels because of less available protein for binding, making the total levels unreliable. It is important to understand that phenytoin exhibits nonlinear (zero- order) kinetics, as the metabolic pathways responsible for its metabolism become saturated. This means that when the dose of phenytoin is increased beyond a certain point, its plasma concentration at steady state will no longer increase in a proportionate manner. Rather, small dose changes may result in a large/toxic increment in plasma concentrations. In general, phenytoin approaches zero-order kinetics at total levels of >10 to 15 μ g/mL, and small dose increments can potentially cause large 410 increases in the serum level. Idiosyncratic reactions caused by phenytoin include aplastic anemia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and hepatic failure. Other side effects include thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, gingival hyperplasia, acne, coarse facial features (also called “phenytoin facies,” from hypertrophy of subcutaneous facial tissue), hirsutism, purple glove syndrome (with intravenous administration), nystagmus, ataxia, dysarthria, diplopia, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Phenytoin can also cause folate deficiency and increased vitamin D metabolism, resulting in premature osteoporosis. Chronically, its use has been associated with a usually mild peripheral neuropathy and with cerebellar but not cortical atrophy. Acutely, the IV form can cause phlebitis, pain, burning, hypotension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Phenytoin is a liver enzyme inducer, so it can increase metabolism of many other drugs. There are variations of calculating loading and correcting doses of phenytoin. A general simple formula for calculating a supplementing (or loading) IV bolus of phenytoin is as follows: (target total phenytoin level − current total phenytoin level) × (kilogram body weight × volume of distribution). The therapeutic range for phenytoin is 10 to 20 μ g/mL. The range for volume of distribution for phenytoin is 0.5 to 1 L/kg, with an average of 0.8 L/kg often used. If we insert the numbers from the case into the formula, the calculation will be as follows: (15 − 10) × (75 × 0.8) = 300 mg. An accurate reassessment of new levels can be obtained by checking free and total levels approximately 2 hours after the IV load. Ahn JE, Cloyd JC, Brundage RC, et al.

If we apply this formula to the case, the result is as follows: (100 − 70) × (70 × 0.2) = 420 mg. Valproic acid has broad-spectrum antiseizure activity and is commonly used in partial GTC, absence, myoclonic, and tonic seizures, as well as infantile spasms. Its mechanism of action is by sodium and T-type calcium channel antagonism, and it also works as an agonist at the GABA A receptor. It primarily undergoes liver metabolism and is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor. Side effects include cognitive and gastrointestinal complaints. Infrequently, it can cause increased liver enzymes and, rarely, idiosyncratic fatal hepatitis (most common in those <2 years of age). Chronically, it can cause weight gain, hair thinning, polycystic ovarian syndrome, acne, menstrual irregularities, tremor, pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia. Cerebellar atrophy occurs with long-term phenytoin use but not with valproic acid. Valproic acid significantly increases the half-life of lamotrigine by 24 to 48 hours.

      "explicacao": "Carbamazepine is used for partial or secondarily GTC seizures, although it is important to remember that it can rarely worsen some generalized epilepsies (including myoclonic and absence epilepsies), similar to phenytoin. Its primary mode of action is via blockade of sodium channels, which leads to a decrease/prevention of repetitive firing in depolarized neurons. Side effects include dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, drowsiness, diplopia, nystagmus, rash, headache, nausea, vomiting, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, and ataxia. Serious idiosyncratic reactions include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, leukopenia, and aplastic anemia. Carbamazepine undergoes liver metabolism with renal excretion of metabolites, so caution is advised with kidney or liver failure. Carbamazepine is also a hepatic enzyme inducer and undergoes autoinduction. The dose must be titrated up gradually to allow tolerance to develop to its CNS side effects, to avoid early toxicity, and to achieve an optimal therapeutic level as carbamazepine “autoinduces” the hepatic enzymes responsible for its own metabolism. If carbamazepine is started at too high of a dose, or titrated too fast, the result would be elevated carbamazepine levels with accompanying toxicity early on, as the hepatic enzymes responsible for carbamazepine’s metabolism have not been fully activated (autoinduced) yet. It is, therefore, important to remember that carbamazepine’s half-life decreases from 30 hours to 10 to 20 hours after the first few days to weeks of use. Autoinduction is completed after 3 to 5 weeks of a fixed dosing regimen. Plasma concentrations decrease in the first 1 to 2 months, and during this time, the dose of carbamazepine should be gradually increased. Therefore, carbamazepine would not be a good option if quick control of new-onset, frequent seizures was desired. Of note, oxcarbazepine does not undergo autoinduction and can be titrated faster. Oxcarbazepine is a structural derivative of carbamazepine and is reduced to 10-monohydroxy-carbamazepine and unlike carbamazepine does not undergo oxidation to epoxide. Carbamazepine on the other hand is oxidized to 10,11- 413 carbamazepine epoxide, which is the principal metabolite of carbamazepine. It is important to remember that the 10,11- carbamazepine epoxide is pharmacologically active and responsible for many of the side effects seen with carbamazepine use. Because of these differences, oxcarbazepine has less side effects, overall, as compared to carbamazepine. Oxcarbazepine has less liver enzyme induction, no autoinduction (and can thus be titrated more rapidly), and is used for the same seizure types as carbamazepine, having the same mechanism of action, metabolic pathways, and side effect profile. Approximately 30% of patients who have a history of a rash with carbamazepine will also develop a rash when exposed to oxcarbazepine. Valproic acid inhibits the metabolism of the pharmacologically active 10,11-carbamazepine epoxide (the principal metabolite of carbamazepine). Thus, although the carbamazepine level may be normal, the patient may experience toxicity because of elevated 10,11-carbamazepine epoxide levels. The 10,11-carbamazepine epoxide is not routinely measured but can be ordered specifically if there are concerns about toxicity. Koch MW, Polman SK.

      "explicacao": "Lamotrigine is typically well tolerated as long as it is introduced gradually with a slow titration, although dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, and ataxia may be seen. Stevens–Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis, is associated with concurrent use of valproic acid or rapid lamotrigine titration, and this risk appears to be increased in those younger than 16 years. Cognitive disturbances are much less common with lamotrigine compared to many other AEDs. Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy increase lamotrigine clearance and, thus, decrease serum lamotrigine levels. This effect appears to be limited to contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol. Progesterone-only medications do not appear to have this effect. Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic medication and is used for partial and GTC seizures, as well as generalized seizures of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS). It has also been used for absence and myoclonic seizures, although it is not the first line of therapy for these types of seizures. It works as a sodium channel antagonist and also inhibits glutamate release. It undergoes liver metabolism with renal excretion of metabolites. During pregnancy, lamotrigine clearance may increase up to 65%, which may result in breakthrough seizures. Therefore, monitoring of lamotrigine serum levels with dose adjustments is recommended during pregnancy and after delivery. de Haan GJ, Edelbroek P, Segers J, et al.

It is predominantly excreted unchanged in urine with minimal liver metabolism. Similar to zonisamide, topiramate is also a weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which explains the potential risk of renal stone formation in patients treated with these agents, as well as potential benefit in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri is an older term).

      "explicacao": "This patient has complex partial seizures originating from the temporal lobe, most likely from the mesial temporal lobe region. These are often associated with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis. Complex partial seizures arise from a focal area of epileptogenicity and, unlike simple partial seizures, are associated with impairment of consciousness. Mesial temporal lobe seizures are characterized by behavioral arrest and may be preceded by an aura (a simple partial seizure), such as a rising epigastric sensation, nausea, olfactory and/or gustatory hallucinations, a sensation of fear and terror, or other emotional changes, as well as autonomic manifestations such as tachycardia, respiratory changes, face flushing, or pallor. Patients may also experience dysmnesic manifestations such as déjà vu (sensation of familiarity as if an experience has occurred before, although it has not), déjà entendu (if the experience is auditory), jamais vu (sensation that a familiar experience is new, although it is not), jamais entendu (if the latter experience is auditory), or panoramic vision (a rapid recollection of episodes from the past). During the seizure, the patient may also have automatisms, which are involuntary complex motor activities, such as nose picking, lip smacking, chewing, and picking with the hands. Typically, patients have postictal confusion, which is not present in absence seizures. Frontal lobe seizures are abrupt in onset, brief, and predominantly associated with elementary motor manifestations but may include complex automatisms. They frequently occur in sleep, often in clusters. Parietal lobe seizures are predominantly associated with episodic sensory symptoms, although clinical localization may be difficult as parietal discharges propagate to other brain regions. Occipital lobe seizures usually present with visual phenomena. Given the focal discharges on the EEG and characteristic clinical features, this patient does not have absence seizures.

These patients usually have developmental arrest and a poor prognosis with respect to neurologic recovery, and these types of seizures should be treated. Infantile spasms are better viewed as a type of seizure rather than an epilepsy syndrome and are also discussed in questions 24 and 25. The triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental arrest is known as West’s syndrome. This condition has been associated with multiple etiologies, such as hypoxic– 419 ischemic injuries, brain malformations or structural abnormalities, congenital or acquired infections, chromosomal abnormalities, and inborn errors of metabolism. Infantile spasms are frequent in patients with tuberous sclerosis, and this condition should be considered in this setting. Every patient presenting with infantile spasms should have an appropriate, thorough workup to look for the cause, including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In close to 30% of the cases, no specific etiology is found, and these cases are considered cryptogenic. ACTH is commonly used for the treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH should be used carefully, given its potential side effects, which include hypertension, hyperglycemia, weight gain, electrolyte abnormalities, risk of infections, risk of avascular necrosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Vigabatrin may also be used for the treatment of infantile spasms, especially in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Vigabatrin should be used with caution as it carries the risk of retinal toxicity.

These seizures are frequently associated with apneic spells. The EEG is normal but may demonstrate the “θ pointu alternant” pattern, characterized by discontinuous, asynchronous, unreactive θ-activity with intermixed sharp waves. Patients are neurologically normal. In general, there is no need for treatment with antiepileptic agents, and seizures resolve spontaneously by 4 to 6 weeks of age. Benign neonatal seizures and benign familial neonatal seizures should be diagnoses of exclusion, and workup to rule out symptomatic seizures is indicated. Benign familial neonatal seizures is an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by seizures in the first few days of life, which resolve spontaneously within few weeks.

Patients with ADNFLE present with bizarre episodic behaviors in the context of hypermotor seizures, that is, hyperkinetic seizures with prominent motor phenomena, such as thrashing and jerking. These seizures occur during non-REM sleep, and patients may experience sudden awakenings with motor manifestations. Some patients will be conscious and report auras with epigastric, sensory, or psychic components. Because of the unusual appearance of these seizures, they are often mistaken for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (“pseudoseizures”) or sleep-related disorders. The interictal EEG is usually normal, and the diagnosis is based on capturing the seizures on video EEG. These seizures usually respond well to 427 carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine. Mutations in the genes that encode subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, CNRNA4 and CHRNB2, have been detected. Electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES) presents in children between ages 1 and 12 years (peak around 4 to 5 years) with psychomotor impairment and multiple seizure types that occur more often during sleep. The diagnosis is made with the EEG showing slow spike–wave complexes occurring during non- REM sleep occupying at least 85% of the slow-wave sleep time. This disorder has been linked to Landau–Kleffner syndrome (see question 54).

      "explicacao": "Lateralizing semiological signs and symptoms during epileptic seizures are helpful to predict the side of the seizure focus, and this may have implications on the correct classification of the patient’s epilepsy and for presurgical evaluation in patients whose seizures are difficult to control with AEDs. Auras preceding a seizure represent focal discharges, which activate the area responsible for generation of the patient’s aura at the beginning of the clinical (but 428 not necessarily the electrographic) seizure. Thus, auras may provide a clue with regard to the seizure origin. Some seizures do not start with an aura, but other semiological signs may point toward the origin of these seizures. Eyes and head version, characterized strictly by a forced and involuntary movement leading to an unnatural position of the head toward one side, are associated with a seizure focus in the contralateral hemisphere and more specifically in the frontal region in the frontal eye fields and motor areas anterior to the precentral gyrus. The association of version with the contralateral hemisphere is more robust if the version occurs immediately prior to the secondarily GTC phase. Therefore, the patient in question 56 has a seizure focus in the right frontal region. Question 57 depicts a case of asymmetric tonic posturing during a seizure, which is characteristic of seizures arising from the SMA. This specific case describes the “figure of 4 sign,” in which the extended arm is contralateral to the seizure focus. Therefore, this patient’s seizures originate in the left SMA (see also question 44). Unilateral dystonic hand/arm posture during a seizure has important lateralizing value in temporal lobe epilepsies, suggesting that the seizure arises from the temporal lobe contralateral to the dystonic upper extremity. The suggested hypothesis is that the discharges originate in the hippocampus and the amygdala, spreading via the fornix and through the basal ganglia, more specifically the ventral striatum, pallidum, and anterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with dystonic posture of one upper limb and automatisms in the opposite upper limb have seizures originating in the temporal lobe ipsilateral to the automatisms. In question 58, the seizure focus is in the right temporal lobe. Gelastic seizures are characterized by uncontrollable episodes of laughter that occur in clusters, as depicted in question 59. These seizures are rare, and commonly originate in the hypothalamus, more specifically associated with hypothalamic hamartomas, although gelastic seizures arising from various cortical areas mainly in the frontal and temporal lobe have been well described in the literature. Hypothalamic hamartoma is a congenital malformation that may be asymptomatic in some cases but commonly presents with precocious puberty and seizures. Seizures 429 may progress and the patient may manifest other seizure types. Harvey AS, Freeman JL. Epilepsy in hypothalamic hamartoma: clinical and EEG features.

Computed tomography and MRI of the brain may need to be performed to rule out a new cerebrovascular event; however, the symptoms most likely correlate with the introduction of the two antimicrobial medications resulting in phenytoin toxicity. Given the patient’s symptoms, the most likely cause can be determined by assessing the serum levels of phenytoin. There is no evidence to suggest a new seizure and, therefore, an EEG is not indicated. Urinalysis and urine culture may need to be obtained to rule out an infectious process; however, it is unlikely to be the cause of this patient’s symptoms. Phenytoin is a widely used medication for seizures. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index, nonlinear kinetics, and multiple interactions with other medications, toxicity can occur in patients treated with this medication. Phenytoin can be given orally or intravenously. It binds extensively to albumin (almost 90%); only unbound phenytoin is pharmacologically active. Medications (such as sulfamethoxazole) that displace phenytoin from albumin may increase free levels, producing manifestations of toxicity. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes to inactive metabolites, which are then excreted in the urine. Phenytoin follows zero-order kinetic metabolism (discussed in questions 26 to 28). There is a long list of medications that could potentially interact with the metabolism of phenytoin, either increasing or decreasing its serum levels. Fluconazole and trimethoprim are substrates of the same CYP 450 pathway and can, therefore, raise levels of this AED. 430 The clinical manifestations of phenytoin toxicity are usually neurologic in nature and, depending on the drug level, range from dizziness, nystagmus, ataxia, and other manifestations of cerebellar dysfunction, to lethargy, confusion, and coma.

      "explicacao": "This patient had a simple FS. Febrile seizure is defined as a seizure that occurs in association with a febrile illness in the absence of CNS infection or acute electrolyte imbalance in children without prior afebrile seizures. These occur commonly between 6 months and 5 years of age, with a peak incidence at 18 months. Febrile seizure can be simple or complex. Most FS represent simple FS, that is, generalized, usually isolated, seizures of relatively brief duration lasting less than 15 minutes. Complex FSs, on the contrary, are prolonged, lasting more than 15 minutes, have focal features, and may occur multiple times in the course of the same febrile illness, or within the same 24-hour period. A prior history of a complex FS is a known risk factor for subsequent development of epilepsy, whereas a family history of FS does not increase the risk of subsequent epilepsy. Interestingly, a prior history of a complex FS has not been found to be associated with a higher risk for recurrence of FS. Risk factors to develop a first FS include a first- or second-degree relative with a history of FS, developmental delay, neonatal nursery stay for more than 30 days, and attendance of day care. Most patients will have only one FS without recurrence and without subsequent development of epilepsy. Recurrent FS may 431 occur, especially in the presence of recognizable risk factors, which include a family history of FS, age younger than 18 months at the time of the first FS, lower peak temperature, and shorter duration of fever prior to the FS. Simple FS or complex FS carries similar risk of recurrence. The risk of developing epilepsy following a single simple FS is not substantially different than the risk in the general population. On the contrary, patients with complex FS may be at risk of developing epilepsy in the future. The risk is even higher when the complex FS was very prolonged in duration (i.e., febrile status epilepticus). Other risk factors to develop epilepsy include the presence of a neurodevelopmental abnormality and/or family history of epilepsy. Importantly, a family history of FS does not predispose the patient to subsequent development of epilepsy. The evaluation of patients with FS should be targeted at assessing the cause of the seizure and ruling out CNS infections or abnormalities. The exact pathophysiology of FS remains unclear. A relationship between prolonged FS and mesial temporal lobe sclerosis has been proposed; however, this association is controversial and has not conclusively been confirmed in prospective and population-based studies. Long-term prophylaxis and AEDs are not indicated for FS but can be considered in some cases, especially if a high risk of recurrence exists. In these cases, phenobarbital or valproic acid can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Short-term prophylaxis may also be needed in some cases and should be focused on temperature control during febrile illness and use of benzodiazepines, such as rectal diazepam gel.

The patient has various characteristics suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder, including migraines, short stature, ataxia, cognitive impairment, deafness, epilepsy, and elevated lactate. He has generalized proximal weakness suggesting a myopathy, and the muscle biopsy in Figure 5.6 demonstrates ragged red fibers, which supports the diagnosis. 433 Mitochondrial disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders that can affect both the peripheral and central nervous system. Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers is a mitochondrial disorder that usually starts in the second or third decade of life and is maternally inherited (like other disorders of mitochondrial DNA). Cerebrospinal fluid studies will show elevation of pyruvate and lactate, and the serum creatine kinase may be elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain usually demonstrates cerebral atrophy. Point mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been detected in this disorder. Mutation affecting cystatin B is seen with EPM1 mutations in Unverricht–Lundborg syndrome. Cherry red spot is seen in various conditions, including sialidosis, which is another PME. EPM2A mutation is seen in Lafora body disease, in which Lafora bodies are also detected on skin biopsy.

These patients do not have psychomotor or cognitive deterioration or dysmorphism, and, characteristically, the fundoscopic examination demonstrates a cherry red spot. Type II is caused by deficiency of N -acetyl neuraminidase and β-galactosialidase and begins between the neonatal period and the second decade of life. These patients have myoclonus, along with coarse facial features, corneal clouding, hepatomegaly, skeletal dysplasia, and learning disabilities. The sialidoses are autosomal recessive, and the gene implicated is NEU1 in chromosome 6p21.3.

The EEG shows an evolution, with multiple spike–wave discharges at the beginning, but progressively over months or years, the background deteriorates and multifocal epileptiform abnormalities appear, mainly in the occipital regions, in addition to generalized bursts. Lafora bodies are periodic-acid-Schiff–positive intracellular polyglucosan inclusion bodies found in neurons, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, hepatocytes, and sweat gland duct cells, making it possible to detect these bodies in skin biopsy specimens.

This condition most frequently affects children, though adolescents and adults may also be affected. The pathogenesis is not well understood; however, it is known that it is an inflammatory condition, and an antibody has been detected targeted against the GluR3 subunit of the AMPA receptor, which is a glutamate receptor. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates cortical atrophy that is progressive and focal areas of white matter hyperintensity. Histopathologic findings demonstrate perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes and monocytes, as well as glial nodules in the gray and white matter. The continuous neuron loss leaves areas of spongy tissue degeneration. In Rasmussen’s encephalitis, seizures are not typically well controlled with AED monotherapy and are usually intractable. Anti- inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids and other immune modulating treatments including IV immune globulin and plasmapheresis have been tried with some promise but variable success.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of AEDs are altered in the elderly. These patients tend to have lower gastric acidity, making the weakly basic drugs less easily absorbed and weakly acidic drugs more easily absorbed. Gastric emptying may be slowed and intestinal villi height may be reduced, making the absorption surface smaller. Given that lean body mass decreases with aging, total body water mass decreases, making the volume of distribution of hydrophilic drugs smaller. The proportion of fat also decreases with age, reducing lipophilic drug distribution volume. The metabolism of drugs is also affected, and hepatic metabolism decreases, given the reduction in liver volume, hepatic flow, and bile flow. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are lower in the elderly, and, therefore, renal excretion is also decreased. Hepatic synthesis of protein is lower, and the free fraction of drug that binds to protein tends to increase. Therefore, the measurement of free drug levels is recommended if available for that specific drug. The therapeutic window is also smaller in elderly patients. These patients tend to have multiple comorbidities and are usually on multiple medications that could potentially interact with AEDs. Therefore, careful selection of drugs and monitoring for side effects are strongly recommended in this group of patients. Jetter GM, Cavazos JE. Epilepsy in the elderly.

      "explicacao": "Valproic acid is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic agent that can be used in various seizure types. Its acts by blocking sodium channels, but it may have other mechanisms of action, including effects on GABA A receptors and T-type calcium channels. This medication is widely used; however, it has various side effects. These include weight gain, alopecia, tremor, gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, and pancreatitis. It can be hepatotoxic and even produce fulminant hepatic failure and hyperammonemia, leading to encephalopathy. It can be undesirable in women, as it may produce a polycystic ovarian syndrome with menstrual 437 irregularities, and it is teratogenic, specifically producing neural tube defects. Valproic acid is an enzyme inhibitor and may lead to interactions with other medications, elevating the levels of many medications, including other AEDs. Osteoporosis from vitamin D deficiency is postulated to occur from enzyme-inducing antiepileptic agents; however, vitamin D deficiency is also seen in patients taking valproic acid monotherapy. Hyponatremia is not a side effect of valproic acid and is more commonly seen with carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

This medication in general has few side effects and does not interact with other medications; however, it can produce significant behavioral problems and emotional lability, sometimes agitation and even aggressiveness. Levetiracetam should be used carefully in the elderly and in patients with psychiatric disorders, with alternative medications used when possible. Of the antiepileptic agents mentioned in the options, the one that presents most behavioral side effects is levetiracetam. Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum AED that has no significant adverse impact on cognition and behavior and has few side effects if titrated slowly, with skin rash being the main side effect. Valproic acid, besides being used for epilepsy, is also used as a mood stabilizer. Carbamazepine and phenytoin can produce fatigue, dizziness, nystagmus, ataxia, and sedation but usually not the behavioral problems seen with levetiracetam. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient had a first unprovoked seizure. The International League Against Epilepsy defines this as a seizure occurring in a person older than 1 month with no history of unprovoked seizures. This definition excludes neonatal seizures, febrile seizures (FS), or seizures in the setting of an acute precipitating cause. According to practice parameter guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology, there is good evidence to support both the use of a routine EEG and brain imaging with CT 439 or MRI in patients presenting with a first unprovoked seizure. There is inadequate evidence to support or refute laboratory studies, lumbar puncture, and toxicology screens. However, specific clinical circumstances may support the need for these additional tests on an individual basis, such as if the patient is febrile and CNS infection is suspected, in which case a lumbar puncture would be diagnostic. The risk of seizure recurrence is influenced by various parameters. According to the 2015 practice parameter guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology, there is strong evidence for seizure recurrence in the presence of a prior brain insult such as trauma or stroke, or an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities. There is moderate evidence for seizure recurrence when there are brain imaging abnormalities, or nocturnal seizures. Not every patient with a first unprovoked seizure needs to be treated. According to the same 2015 guidelines, there is strong evidence that seizure recurrence is greatest in the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). The decision to treat is a complex one and depends on the risk of recurrence on the basis of the factors mentioned, the risk–benefit ratio of treatment, and other patient- specific considerations. Immediate AED therapy as compared with the delay of treatment pending a second seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence in the subsequent 2 years, but it may not improve quality of life. Furthermore, over the longer term (>3 years), immediate AED therapy is unlikely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission. The risk of AED adverse effects ranges from 7% to 31%, but they are predominantly mild and reversible. Haut SR, Shinnar S. Considerations in the treatment of a first unprovoked seizure.

The EEG recording is based on differential amplification, in which the difference in voltage between two sites is compared with each recording channel. This recording helps in the evaluation and diagnosis of abnormalities in brain electrical activity but is also useful in the evaluation of other neurologic conditions. Patients undergoing an evaluation for “spells” will often have to obtain an EEG to determine the presence or absence of epileptogenic activity. During a routine recording, various procedures are utilized to enhance potentially abnormal electrical activity. These so-called activation procedures include hyperventilation, photic stimulation, sleep deprivation prior to the EEG, and recording during sleep. Noxious stimulation is not part of the EEG activation procedures. Hyperventilation may produce generalized slowing or no effect in normal subjects; however, in certain epilepsies, such as absence epilepsy, hyperventilation may activate epileptiform discharges and even seizures. Photic stimulation is performed with various frequencies and may be helpful to induce epileptiform activity and seizures, most commonly myoclonic seizures, in individuals with photosensitive epilepsies. Sleep deprivation may also enhance epileptogenic activity. Furthermore, seizures may occur 442 predominantly (or exclusively) during sleep in certain epilepsy syndromes, and EEG abnormalities may not be seen in the awake patient. Therefore, an EEG may be incomplete without a sleep recording. Tatum WO. Handbook of EEG Interpretation, 2nd ed. New York, NY: Demos Medical Publishing, LLC; 2014."

      "explicacao": "The EEG in Figure 5.8 shows diffuse slowing and triphasic waves, suggesting a metabolic encephalopathy. Triphasic waves represent a special type of continuous generalized slow activity, with characteristic slow waves that consist of three phases, beginning with a small negative (upward) wave, followed by a prominent positive (downward) wave, and ending in a negative (upward) wave. These waveforms typically occur in a bilaterally symmetric, bisynchronous fashion with an anterior-to-posterior lag. They are seen in various types of toxic and/or metabolic encephalopathies that involve altered states of consciousness, most commonly in hepatic encephalopathy. Other common causes include uremia, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte disturbances, such as hyponatremia or hypercalcemia. Generalized periodic patterns are characterized by the appearance of generalized sharp wave discharges occurring in a periodic fashion. A generalized periodic pattern with a 1-Hz frequency is a characteristic finding of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). Although triphasic waves may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from generalized epileptiform activity, especially when occurring in prolonged runs, the EEG pattern seen in this figure would not be typical of a generalized seizure. Postcardiac arrest anoxia can produce various EEG patterns, including α-coma, burst suppression, and electrocerebral silence in the case of brain death. It should be noted that triphasic-appearing waves are also seen in anoxic brain injury. Infantile spasms are associated with the EEG finding of hypsarrhythmia (see questions 24 and 25). Tatum WO.

Burst suppression signifies severe bilateral cerebral dysfunction. The etiology of burst suppression is nonspecific. This pattern may be iatrogenic, such as in general anesthesia or in barbiturate coma (as treatment for status epilepticus), among others. It may have a good prognosis in intoxications but typically signifies a poor prognosis when seen in patients with a hypoxic–ischemic insult. Patients with burst suppression are comatose and usually show no reactivity to activation procedures. Patients in status epilepticus intractable to antiepileptic agents may need to be treated with pharmacologically induced coma, in which case the therapy is initially targeted to burst suppression.

These are seen in structural brain lesions (usually in the acute or subacute setting), such as in a stroke, hemorrhage, infection (importantly, HSV encephalitis), brain abscess, or tumor, and are usually transient, disappearing with time as the patient recovers from the acute event. Typically, patients with PLEDs are encephalopathic with a diffusely slow EEG background. Usually, PLEDs are not thought to represent ongoing ictal activity and are considered among the interictal phenomena/patterns. It is important to remember, however, that 444 seizures may be seen in a significant number of patients who are found to have PLEDs on EEG. Burst suppression is described in question 79.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Figure 5.12 shows a K-complex and sleep spindle, which are features of stage N2 sleep, as discussed further below. 445 Sleep stages are separated into four stages: stage NREM1 (N1), stage NREM 2 (N2), stage NREM 3 (N3), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Stages 3 and 4 sleep, previously considered separate stages, are now combined together and called slow-wave sleep. Normal sleep consists of 4 to 6 cycles/night of non-REM (NREM) sleep, with each cycle followed by a period of REM sleep. The first REM period normally occurs around 90 minutes after sleep onset. The sleep stages are defined electrographically by certain criteria as specified by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine scoring manual. Some characteristics of the different sleep stages are as follows: Stage N1: This stage normally occupies approximately 5% of total sleep time. It is marked polysomnographically by slow rolling eye movements, a reduction in muscle artifact, attenuation of the occipital dominant α-rhythm, and increasing slower frequencies. Diphasic sharp waves maximal at the vertex (vertex sharp waves) and positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS) are other features. Stage N2: Typically accounts for approximately 45% of sleep time. This stage is characterized on polysomnogram by the presence of K complexes, such as the one depicted in Figure 5.12 . A K-complex is a diphasic wave (with an initial upward and then a downward deflection) that is maximal over frontocentral regions. The other main feature of stage N2 is the sleep spindle, also seen in Figure 5.12 (red arrow), following the K complex (yellow arrow). K-complexes typically appear around 5 months of age. A sleep spindle is relatively high frequency (12 to 14 Hz), brief (<2 seconds) activity that is maximal over central regions. Delta activity may be present but occupies less than 20% of this stage of sleep. Developmentally, sleep spindles first appear around 2 months of life but do not reach adult appearance until 2 years. Stage N3, or slow wave sleep, was previously separated into stages 3 and 4. It typically accounts for 20% to 25% of sleep time but decreases with increasing age. In N3, delta activity accounts for more than 20% of visually detectable frequencies. REM sleep accounts for 20% to 25% of sleep time. Alpha activity, reminiscent of that seen during wakefulness, may be seen in occipital leads. Obviously, this stage is characterized by the 446 presence of rapid eye movements, as is seen in Figure 5.14A (yellow arrows). Other features include sawtooth waves in central regions. Normally during REM sleep, most muscles are atonic (aside from the diaphragm and extraocular muscles). REM sleep atonia is seen on polysomnography as minimal activity in surface EMG leads placed on the chin, as seen in Figure 5.14A (green arrows; discussed further in questions 92 and 93). REM sleep accounts for up to 50% of sleep time in neonates, and the percentage of sleep spent in REM sleep then decreases with increasing age. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors reduce the length of time spent in REM sleep and increase REM sleep latency. The amount of sleep required is greatest in the neonatal period and decreases across the life span. While in the average adult population, sleep requirements are typically in the range of 7 to 8 hours, this is highly variable and long sleep requirements (>10 hours per night) and short sleep requirements (<6 hours a night) may both occur.

Apneas and hypopneas are characterized by complete cessation or reduction of airflow, respectively, for at least 10 seconds. In addition, obstructive hypopneas/apneas are associated with EEG arousal and/or oxygen desaturation (of 3% to 4%, depending on the criteria being employed). The AHI is a 447 measure of how many apneas and hypopneas, on average, occur per hour. An AHI of 5 to 15 per hour is considered mildly elevated, of 15 to 30 per hour moderately elevated, and more than 30 per hour is severely elevated. A similar index of apneas and hypopneas is the so-called respiratory disturbance index, which in addition to apneas and hypopneas also accounts for respiratory-event-related arousals.

This syndrome is characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, associated with arousals and/or oxygen desaturations. Patients may have snoring and gasping/choking episodes. Symptoms of OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and fragmented sleep. To support a diagnosis of sleep apnea, apneas or hypopneas should occur five or more times per hour and last at least 10 seconds each, as detected by polysomnogram (discussed further in question 86). During obstructive apneas, respiratory effort is present, differentiating this condition from central sleep apnea (discussed in question 88), in which there is no respiratory effort. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is more frequently seen in obese patients and in those with small or crowded upper airways and short necks. The use of alcohol and sedatives may reduce airway tone, worsening OSA syndrome. Besides the clinical manifestations directly associated with OSA syndrome, patients with this condition are at a higher risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Patients with OSA are at higher risk to develop cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, cor pulmonale, as well as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Management includes weight loss, avoidance of alcohol and sedatives, and use of positive airway pressure.

This disorder is characterized by periods of absent airflow ( Fig. 5.13 , yellow arrows) along with a cessation of ventilatory effort during sleep, alternating with periods of a crescendo–decrescendo respiratory flow (tidal volume) ( Fig. 5.13 , red arrows). The clinical manifestations of CSAS are similar to those of OSA, because patients will often experience insomnia, inability to maintain sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness, as well as arousals, bradycardia or tachycardia, and desaturations during the apneas. In central apnea, there is a transient central cessation of respiratory drive, and airway obstruction does not occur. Polysomnogram is helpful in making the diagnosis, showing episodes of apnea, in which there is no respiratory effort. This type of sleep-disordered breathing is much less common than OSA. Comorbid heart failure is a frequent cause of CSAS. Treating the underlying heart failure may improve the sleep disorder though in some patients, positive airway pressure treatment is needed.

Clinically, it is characterized by a transient paralysis during sleep onset or on awakening; the patient is fully conscious 452 during these events. Sleep paralysis is a feature of narcolepsy (discussed in question 95) but can be seen in normal individuals as well. REM sleep, as described in questions 83 to 85, is normally characterized by atonia in most muscles (discussed in question 92), though muscle tone in the extraocular muscles and diaphragm is maintained. Because accessory respiratory muscles are atonic, REM sleep is a period of increased risk for obstructive respiratory events. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur at sleep onset. A useful mnemonic is that the word “go” is present in the word hypna go gic, as in going to sleep. These hallucinations may be seen in normal individuals but are also associated with narcolepsy. Hypnopompic hallucinations occur on awakening from sleep. These may occur in normal individuals and in narcolepsy and do not generally suggest a primary psychotic disorder. While dreams occur predominantly during REM sleep, evidence indicates that they occur during non-REM sleep as well. During REM sleep, there is a normal (physiologic) variability that occurs in heart rate (as reflected by variations in the R-R interval on the electrocardiogram lead). In fact, reduced heart rate variability is considered a sign of dysautonomia. American Academy of Sleep Medicine. International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed.

This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia that typically occur weeks or months apart. Onset is in early adolescence and the episodes can last for 453 several days and sometimes weeks, appearing many times per year. Patients sleep for prolonged periods of time, 18 to 20 hours, often waking only to eat and void. During these episodes, patients may exhibit irritability, aggressiveness, confusion, hypersexuality, and a voracious appetite. Disturbance of social life is significant during these episodes. In between episodes, patients sleep normal amounts and behave normally. This disorder is more common in males but can occur in females, in whom episodes of hypersomnolence may occur around the time of menstruation. While idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy (discussed in question 95) are marked by hypersomnolence, these are more chronic rather than the intermittent episodes seen in Kleine-Levin syndrome. Idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, in the absence of a primary nocturnal sleep disorder, or other medical condition or factor that could account for the hypersomnolence. Patients complain of hypersomnia and sleep for long periods of time, but the sleep is not refreshing. The diagnosis is made only when no other medical or psychiatric condition can explain the hypersomnia. Narcolepsy in its classic form, now called type 1 narcolepsy, is a disorder that is characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. Patients with narcolepsy suffer sleep attacks, with episodes of involuntary sleep in inappropriate circumstances. Brief episodes of sleep, or volitional naps, lasting 15 to 30 minutes are usually refreshing. In delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) (discussed in question 97), the major sleep episode is delayed in relation to societal norms, resulting in symptoms that may be confused with sleep- onset insomnia, as well as difficulty awakening. When these patients are able to sleep according to their preferred schedule, there is no problem with falling asleep or waking up.

This is a disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations (discussed in question 93). Patients with narcolepsy suffer sleep attacks, in which the patient has an irresistible desire to fall asleep during inappropriate circumstances. These sleep attacks are short, lasting 15 to 30 minutes, and the patient feels refreshed afterward. Although cataplexy is associated with narcolepsy, not all patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy. Cataplexy is characterized by episodes of sudden loss of tone of voluntary muscles, sparing respiratory and ocular muscles. During these attacks, remove the patients may fall and be unable to move, and deep tendon reflexes are decreased or absent. Patients have preserved consciousness. Cataplectic attacks may be triggered by emotional events, such as laughter or anger. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is supported by two features on a daytime multiple sleep latency test: (i) a mean sleep latency of 8 minutes or less and (ii) REM sleep within 15 minutes of sleep onset, during at least two of four nap trials. Cataplexy may be misdiagnosed as seizures, pseudoseizures, or conversion disorder/psychogenic events. However, the triggering of episodes by emotion as well as other features including hypersomnolence should prompt consideration of narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis, transient paralysis that intrudes from REM sleep into wakefulness, is also commonly associated with narcolepsy (discussed in question 93). Gamma-hydroxybutyrate has been approved for the treatment of sleepiness and cataplexy in the United States. Other treatment options for cataplexy include tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This patient does not have Kleine–Levin syndrome (discussed in question 94), which is a type of episodic hypersomnia characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia that typically occur weeks or months apart.

      "explicacao": "This patient has a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, specifically delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). Circadian rhythm disorders are characterized by a misalignment between the patient’s sleep pattern and the sleep pattern regarded as the societal norm. In 456 DSPS, the major sleep episode is delayed in relation to the desired, conventional bedtime, resulting in perceived sleep-onset insomnia and difficulty awakening. When these patients are able to sleep at the bedtime they are inclined to, there is no problem with falling asleep or waking up. This condition is more common in adolescents. Treatment may include chronotherapy or melatonin. This patient does not have chronic insomnia disorder, advanced sleep phase syndrome, non–24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder, or shift work sleep disorder. In chronic insomnia disorder (discussed in question 100), patients worry about being unable to sleep and focus on their insomnia, which causes frustration and further inability to fall asleep. In advanced sleep phase syndrome, the major sleep episode is advanced in relation to the desired clock time, resulting in early evening sleepiness and early sleep onset, as well as early awakening time (as discussed in question 98). This condition is more common in older adults. In shift work sleep disorder, patients experience symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occurs as transient phenomena in relation to work schedules (discussed in question 99). In non–24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder (also known as “free-running disorder”), the 24- hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm are not in synchrony. This disorder typically occurs in blind individuals in whom endogenous circadian rhythm entrainment does not occur because of lack of photic input into the circadian pacemaker. Non– 24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder manifests with periods of perceived insomnia and daytime sleepiness, as a progressively delaying sleep–wake pattern emerges, alternating with brief asymptomatic periods. This contrasts with DSPS in which symptoms are relatively stable. Jet lag syndrome is another circadian rhythm disorder caused by the travel across multiple time zones, which there is no history of in this case. The suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus is known as the circadian pacemaker and regulates biological circadian rhythms. In DSPS, circadian markers are altered: melatonin reaches maximal levels and core body temperature reaches a minimum later as compared to controls that follow sleep and wake times more consistent with societal norms.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "The major outflow of the basal ganglia arises in the globus pallidus interna (GPi). Projections from the GPi to the thalamus are inhibitory, as discussed further below. Projections to the basal ganglia arise from several areas. The majority of cortical projections to the basal ganglia target the striatum, which consists of the caudate and putamen. The cortex also projects directly to the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The striatum also receives projections from the thalamus, substantia nigra, and brainstem (including projections from the norepinephrine-containing neurons in the locus coeruleus and serotonergic raphe nuclei). The lenticular nucleus (also known as the lentiform nucleus) consists of the putamen and globus pallidus. The globus pallidus is divided into globus pallidus externa (GPe) and GPi. The major efferent pathways from the basal ganglia arise from the GPi as well as the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and project to the ventrolateral and ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus. This projection of the GPi and SNr is inhibitory. The thalamus then projects to the motor and premotor cortex. The circuitry often referred to in discussion of the basal ganglia can therefore be summarized as cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical. Through various efferent and afferent pathways, the basal ganglia are involved in movement of the trunk and extremities and extraocular muscles, as well as in cognition and emotion. Basal ganglia circuitry is complex, but certain simplifications allow for a basic understanding of basal ganglia function. The circuits of the basal ganglia can be thought of as consisting of two pathways: the indirect pathway and the direct pathway ( Fig. 6.9 ). 500 The direct pathway ( Fig. 6.9A ) consists of the caudate/putamen, GPi, SNr, and thalamus. In the direct pathway, the cerebral cortex sends excitatory projections to the caudate/putamen, which send inhibitory projections to the GPi and SNr. The GPi and SNr normally send inhibitory projections to the thalamus, and inhibition of the GPi and SNr therefore disinhibits the thalamus, increasing thalamic outflow to the cortex. The indirect pathway consists of the caudate/putamen, GPe, STN, GPi, and thalamus ( Fig. 6.9B ). In the indirect pathway, the cortex sends excitatory projections to the caudate/putamen, which sends inhibitory projections to the GPe. The GPe normally has inhibitory projections to the STN, and inhibition of the GPe by striatal projections disinhibits the STN. The STN then sends excitatory projections to the GPi. Recall that the GPi sends inhibitory projections to the thalamus. Therefore, the indirect pathway ultimately inhibits the thalamus, reducing thalamic outflow to the cortex. 501 Figure 6.9 Schematic of normal basal ganglia circuitry. A: Direct. B: Indirect pathways. Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. (Reprinted with permission of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.) The substantia nigra is a structure located between the crus cerebri and the tegmentum of the midbrain. It is a pigmented structure containing a high density of dopaminergic neurons. The substantia nigra pars compacta projects to the striatum, inhibiting the indirect pathway and exciting the direct pathway. A mnemonic for basal ganglia circuitry is as follows: Direct pathway: C innamon c andy g reat in t aste (CCG i T): Cortex → Caudate/putamen → Globus pallidus interna → Thalamus 502 Indirect pathway: Cinnamon c andy g reat excitement and s uper g reat in t aste (CCG e SG i T): Cortex → Caudate/putamen → Globus pallidus externa → Subthalamic nucleus → Globus pallidus interna → Thalamus In summary, because projections from the GPi to the thalamus are inhibitory: • The direct pathway is excitatory: through inhibition of the GPi, it increases thalamocortical activity. • The indirect pathway is inhibitory: through excitation of the GPi, it decreases thalamocortical activity. • These circuits are further discussed in questions 3 and 4. As mentioned, the circuits depicted here are oversimplifications and do not account for many of the connections that mediate movement that are known to exist. For example, the cortex also projects directly to the subthalamic nucleus, the so-called hyperdirect pathway. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Thalamic projections to the motor cortex are excitatory; increased activity in thalamocortical projections leads to hyperkinetic movement disorders and decreased activity in hypokinetic movement disorders. The anatomy of the direct and indirect pathways is described in questions 1 and 2 and Figure 6.9 . Because activity in the direct pathway increases activity in thalamic projections to the motor cortex, the direct pathway plays a major role in initiating and maintaining movement. A reduction in activity of the direct 503 pathway therefore reduces movement. Similarly, because the indirect pathway decreases activity in thalamocortical projections, the indirect pathway suppresses movement. Many movement disorders can be explained by reduced or increased activity in the direct or indirect pathway. In general, hyperkinetic movement disorders (those associated with increased and/or extraneous movements) result from reduced activity in the indirect pathway, whereas hypokinetic movement disorders (those marked by a reduction in movement) result from reduced activity in the direct pathway and this will be the premise for the following discussion. (Note however that many movement disorders lead to a combination of hyperkinesia and bradykinesia, with the prototype being Parkinson’s disease [PD] [discussed in questions 6 and 7], suggesting that the indirect–direct pathway model is an oversimplification and does not fully explain many movement disorders.) The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) has a modulatory role, by inhibiting the indirect pathway and exciting the direct pathway. The SNc degenerates in PD. Reduced SNc activity leads to a reduction in thalamocortical output due to reduced excitation of the direct pathway (and reduced inhibition of the indirect pathway) ( Fig. 6.10A ). Therefore, one hallmark of PD is bradykinesia. Reduced direct pathway activity obviously does not explain the tremor that occurs in PD. In disorders in which chorea is the most prominent feature, such as Huntington’s disease (HD), a reduction of activity in the indirect pathway disinhibits the thalamus, leading to increased activity ( Fig. 6.10B ). Bradykinesia is also a feature of HD. In fact, Parkinsonism in HD develops in the late stages where it eventually replaces chorea. Thus, a reduction in indirect pathway activity does not fully explain the abnormalities of movement seen in this disorder, again cautioning against the oversimplification of these models. 504 Figure 6.10 Schematic of basal ganglia circuitry in ( A ) Parkinson’s disease and ( B ) chorea.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "D 1 receptors are primarily found on neurons involved in the direct pathway, and D 2 receptors on neurons involved in the indirect pathway. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia; it is the neurotransmitter released at the majority of excitatory synapses, including cortical projections to the striatum, projections of the subthalamic nucleus to the globus pallidus interna (GPi), and projections of the thalamus to the cortex. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the basal ganglia and is the neurotransmitter released in projections of the striatum to the globus pallidus and the GPi to the thalamus. Various peptides colocalize with these neurotransmitters, including neuropeptide Y, dynorphin, and enkephalin. Whether or not dopamine acts as an excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter depends on the receptor it is acting at. There are two families of dopamine receptors: D 1 and D 2 . The D 1 to D 5 subtypes of the D 1 family of dopamine receptors are metabotropic receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase. D 1 receptors are primarily found on neurons involved in the direct pathway, and D 2 receptors on neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The substantia nigra pars compacta inhibits the indirect pathway via activity at D 2 receptors in the striatum and excites the direct pathway via activity at D 1 receptors in the striatum ( Fig. 6.9 ). Both D 1 and D 2 receptors are found in neurons of the cortex and the limbic system. D 2 receptors are found in the pituitary gland; activity at D 2 receptors in the pituitary inhibits prolactin release, hence the hyperprolactinemia seen in patients taking antipsychotics (which antagonize D 2 receptors).

      "explicacao": "Both the patients depicted in questions 6 and 7 have histories consistent with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). Parkinsonism is a general term used for patients with tremor, bradykinesia, and/or rigidity. Idiopathic PD is a disorder characterized by tremor, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and/or rigidity, and is the most common cause of parkinsonism. The diagnosis of idiopathic PD is made in the setting of specific clinical features and with a given temporal relation of the symptoms, in the absence of other historical and clinical findings that would suggest alternative causes of parkinsonism. The United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank’s criteria for the diagnosis of PD include the presence of bradykinesia with either rest tremor, rigidity, or postural instability, in addition to at least three of the following features: unilateral onset, rest tremor, progression over time, persistent asymmetry, response to levodopa, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, and/or a clinical course of 10 or more years. As is evident from these criteria, tremor is not necessary for the diagnosis; idiopathic PD can be diagnosed without tremor, as in the case depicted in question 7. Idiopathic PD can be further classified into tremor-predominant and akinetic-rigid forms. Other features of PD are micrographia (small handwriting), hypophonia (reduced voice volume), hypomimia (reduced facial expression), hyposmia or anosmia (reduced or absent sense of smell), and reduced blinking frequency. The diagnosis of idiopathic PD is made on a clinical basis with a high degree of diagnostic accuracy in the majority of cases. In equivocal cases, imaging studies may be helpful (discussed in question 61). Several other disorders may be marked by parkinsonism in addition to other clinical and historical features that suggest the 507 diagnosis is not idiopathic PD. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, hallucinations, and fluctuations in mental status in addition to parkinsonism (discussed in Chapter 12 ). Absence of these features in the histories provided in questions 6 and 7 makes this diagnosis unlikely. Vascular parkinsonism is discussed in question 21, and the history provided makes idiopathic PD more likely. There is no history of exposure to antidopaminergic therapy to suggest drug-induced parkinsonism (discussed in question 21). Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration is discussed in question 20. Absence of a history of falls and no mention of extraocular movement abnormalities makes progressive supranuclear palsy unlikely (discussed in question 17). Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Loss of postural reflexes is a feature of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD), but clinically significant manifestations of it (such as retropulsion with frequent falls) typically occurs later in the course of the disease. The tremor of idiopathic PD is moderate in frequency, 4 to 6 Hz, and is typically more distal than proximal. The tremor has been described as pill rolling, as if the individual is rolling a small pill between the index finger and the thumb. The tremor can involve the legs as well as the head region, most commonly the lips, chin, and jaw, and less often the neck. Although the tremor in idiopathic PD is typically a resting tremor (occurring at rest), postural tremor does occur as well. When a posture (such as outstretched arms) is assumed, there is usually a latency of a few seconds before the tremor appears (this so-called reemergent characteristic of the tremor contrasts with the postural tremor of essential tremor, in which the tremor appears immediately on assumption of a posture, as discussed in questions 22–24). Clinically significant loss of postural reflexes is usually a feature of more advanced PD, occurring several years after disease onset, such that frequent and prominent falls often do not occur until after 8 to 10 years from disease onset. Falling occurs earlier in 508 other parkinsonian disorders; for example, it occurs within the first 2 years of symptom onset in progressive supranuclear palsy (discussed in question 17) and within the first 5 years of symptom onset in multiple-system atrophy (discussed in questions 18 and 19). Freezing, or a sudden transient inability to move, is typically a feature of advanced PD. Features of freezing include hesitation in gait initiation, sudden inability to move when walking through a narrow space, such as a door, and when a target is being approached. Rigidity, or increased resistance during passive range of motion, is a feature of idiopathic PD and is often cogwheeling, or ratchety (rather than spastic), due to the increased tone being superimposed on a tremor. Rigidity can involve both proximal and distal axial and limb muscles. Abnormal postures in PD include striatal hand (ulnar deviation at the wrist with flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension at the interphalangeal joints), striatal toe (extension of the big toe with flexion of the other toes), and camptocormia (extreme flexion of the spine that worsens during walking and improves in the supine position).

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Constipation is a prominent symptom in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). There are many nonmotor symptoms that affect patients with idiopathic PD. In fact, nonmotor features lead to as much, if not more, disability and discomfort as do the motor features. Shoulder pain is a frequent occurrence in PD and can be present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Other joints can also be involved. These pains likely result from rigidity and reduced motion at joints; that these pains are at least in part due to the underlying disorder rather than arthritis or other orthopedic problems is evidenced by improvement of these pains with dopaminergic therapy in some cases. Other types of pain seen in patients with PD include that which is related to dystonia (such as dystonic foot cramping). Nonspecific sensory symptoms (such as paresthesias) in the absence of physical examination findings 509 indicative of neuropathy also occur. These may or may not be responsive to dopaminergic therapy. Urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia are common in patients with PD, occurring in both sexes and resulting from the more generalized autonomic dysfunction that occurs. In PD, urinary symptoms result in large part from detrusor hyperreflexia. Prostatic enlargement can certainly exacerbate these symptoms. Early neurogenic incontinence in a patient with parkinsonism may suggest the diagnosis of multiple-system atrophy (MSA) instead of PD. As mentioned, patients with idiopathic PD do suffer from autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension, and the presence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with parkinsonism does not necessarily imply that their diagnosis is MSA. Unlike MSA, the orthostatic intolerance in PD is usually milder, though it may be severe, and typically occurs later in the course of the disease. Constipation is a prominent symptom in patients with PD, and may predate the motor symptoms for years. It results from impaired gastrointestinal motility due to involvement of the enteric nervous system with the disease. REM sleep behavioral disorder (discussed in question 60) can occur in patients with various neurodegenerative disorders, particularly synucleinopathies, predating other symptoms by years. Its occurrence does not necessarily imply the diagnosis is DLB; it can certainly occur in patients with idiopathic PD. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

Patients with PD typically have hypomimia (reduced facial expression) and apathy, but in this case, the patient’s reported symptoms suggest she is depressed. She should be treated with antidepressant medications; the choice of medications depends on various factors.

A large number of patients with idiopathic PD develop cognitive dysfunction, and dementia is not uncommon. PD with dementia is a diagnosis made when the patient meets criteria for idiopathic PD for at least 1 year before dementia onset. The dementia in these patients is thought to result from involvement of the cortex with Lewy body pathology, though it may be accounted for by concurrent Alzheimer’s disease in some cases as well. In dementia with Lewy bodies DLB (discussed further in Chapter 12 ), cognitive dysfunction and hallucinations antedate the parkinsonism, though they may all occur concurrently. This patient had a near-normal neuropsychologic evaluation 10 years earlier, making DLB unlikely. This patient’s history does not suggest normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) (discussed in Chapter 12 ); 511 NPH can lead to parkinsonism with dementia, but the history suggests this patient had typical idiopathic PD early on, and the dementia occurred years later, without mention of incontinence. Similarly, the description of the patient’s disease early on makes corticobasal ganglionic degeneration less likely (discussed in question 20). The history is not consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (discussed in Chapter 12 ), though FTD and idiopathic PD can co-occur.

      "explicacao": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) results from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The pathologic hallmark of idiopathic PD is the presence of Lewy bodies, which are neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by a clear halo (discussed further in Chapter 12 ) (in contrast to oligodendroglial inclusions seen in multiple system atrophy [MSA], which is discussed in questions 18 and 19). Idiopathic PD is an α- synucleinopathy. The synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal deposition of α-synuclein in the brain (in contrast to tauopathies, which are marked predominantly by tau deposition). While, as mentioned, motor manifestations of idiopathic PD result from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, widespread pathologic changes occur in PD. Pathologic deposition has been demonstrated in various CNS regions including the olfactory system, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei of the brainstem, and basal ganglia. Tissues affected outside the CNS include the enteric nervous system as well as possibly the skin and 512 salivary glands. These widespread changes are thought to account for the multitude of nonmotor symptoms seen in PD. Most cases of PD are sporadic but familial cases occur as well. In a minority of patients with idiopathic PD, single-gene mutations have been identified. The majority of patients with PD do not have an identifiable gene mutation, further suggesting that PD is a complex disorder that is likely the result of both genetic and environmental factors. Several loci for familial PD have been identified. These are genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous, and a full discussion is beyond the scope of this text, but examples include the following: • α-synuclein ( PARK1 gene), leading to abnormalities in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Autosomal dominant, young onset. • Parkin ( PARK2 gene), a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Autosomal recessive, juvenile onset. • Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 and PARK8 gene). The LRRK2 mutation is one of the most common causes of familial PD. Autosomal dominant. Other genes identified in familial PD encode for proteins involved in membrane trafficking, oxidative stress, mitochondrial metabolism, and lysosomal function. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "There are several different classes of therapies for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Entacapone is a catechol- O - methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Dopamine is metabolized by COMT to form 3- O -methyldopa. COMT inhibitors inhibit this 513 conversion, extending the plasma half-life of dopamine, prolonging its duration of action. COMT inhibitors are administered concomitantly with levodopa. They increase the duration of action of levodopa, reducing “off” periods, or periods where the patient is experiencing motor symptoms due to wearing off of the levodopa, and increasing “on” periods. The first dopaminergic agent available for PD was levodopa, which is a dopamine precursor. After levodopa is ingested, it is converted in the brain and peripherally into dopamine by the enzyme dopa-decarboxylase (also called aromatic amino acid decarboxylase). The peripheral conversion accounts for its side effects such as nausea (discussed in question 14). Carbidopa is a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor; it reduces conversion of levodopa into dopamine in the periphery while not inhibiting central conversion. Administration of carbidopa on its own is not of use; it is administered only in combination with levodopa. The dopamine agonists include pramipexole and ropinirole; older dopamine agonists including bromocriptine, pergolide, and cabergoline are no longer commonly used in the treatment of PD. Ropinirole and pramipexole are agonists predominantly at D 2 and D 3 receptors. Rasagiline and selegiline are monoamine oxidase type B (MAOB) inhibitors; MAOB is involved in dopamine metabolism. The relatively selective inhibition of MAOB reduces the risk of the “cheese effect” that could be seen with concomitant intake of high levels of tyramine in certain cheeses, resulting in hypertensive crisis (the older MAO inhibitors that inhibited both MAOA and MAOB had a higher risk of this adverse effect). Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic. Its use in PD is limited to the treatment of tremor, as some of the tremor in PD is thought to result from a relative excess of acetylcholine. Another therapy used in PD includes amantadine, which has antiglutamatergic effects, increases presynaptic dopamine release, and inhibits reuptake of synaptic dopamine. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      "explicacao": "514 Although patients with premorbid impulse control problems are at higher risk of having worsening with dopamine agonist therapy, the dopamine agonists can cause impulse control disorders even in patients without prior history of such problems. The side effects of dopamine agonists include sedation, lower extremity edema, and impulse control problems, such as hypersexuality, pathologic gambling, and pathologic shopping, in addition to other similar behaviors. The occurrence of such impulse control problems often necessitates discontinuation of dopamine agonists. Anticholinergic agents such as trihexyphenidyl and benztropine can cause significant cognitive dysfunction, particularly in older adults, and are thus relatively contraindicated in this age group (also discussed in question 15). Other side effects of these agents include constipation, dry eyes and mouth, and urinary retention. The main side effect of levodopa is nausea; administration of extra doses of carbidopa (which inhibits peripheral conversion of levodopa into dopamine without affecting its conversion centrally) reduces this side effect. Tolerance develops over time. Dyskinesias, or extraneous choreiform movements, occur with levodopa, with the incidence being related to dosage and duration of therapy (with higher risk occurring with increasing duration of therapy). Addition of a catechol- O -methyltransferase inhibitor increases the time dopamine is available at the postsynaptic membrane, increasing the occurrence of peak-dose dyskinesias. Levodopa is more likely to cause dyskinesias compared to dopamine agonists but levodopa-associated dyskinesias should not limit use of levodopa unless they are severe and/or adversely affecting quality of life. Selegiline, a monoamine oxidase type B (MAOB) inhibitor, is metabolized to methamphetamine, which can lead to insomnia. The other MAOB inhibitor, rasagiline, does not have amphetamine-like metabolites. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M. Principles and Practice of Movement Disorders. 2nd ed.

In young patients with predominantly tremor, medications such as rasagiline, amantadine, or even an anticholinergic such as trihexyphenidyl can be used. Dopamine agonists can provide significant motor control, and delaying levodopa therapy may reduce risk of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. In older adults, particularly those with cognitive dysfunction and/or hallucinations, treatment options are more limited. Given this patient’s age, and the history of daytime hypersomnolence, a dopamine agonist (such as ropinirole or pramipexole) would not be appropriate given the side effects discussed in question 14. Bromocriptine is not used in treatment of PD any longer. Trihexyphenidyl would worsen cognitive dysfunction and do little besides perhaps improving the tremor.

In patients with a measurable response to dopaminergic therapy but who over time have less benefits or significant side effects such as dyskinesias, DBS for PD has been proven safe and effective with appropriate case selection. DBS involves the placement of electrodes into specific target areas, with the assistance of stereotaxis and intraoperative neurophysiologic recording. If symptoms predominantly affect only one side of the body, unilateral DBS to a contralateral brain target is appropriate. In patients with significant symptoms bilaterally, 516 bilateral DBS is done. Target sites with documented evidence for efficacy in PD include the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus interna. Ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus DBS is particularly effective for tremor and the VIM is thus the main nucleus targeted in essential tremor but occasionally in tremor-dominant PD as well. Significant cognitive impairment is a contraindication to DBS as significant worsening of cognitive dysfunction can occur postoperatively. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

She had impaired vertical gaze, predominantly on downward gaze. However, on vertical oculocephalic maneuver, downward eye movements were normal. There was mild bilateral rigidity in the upper extremities.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination is consistent with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (previously known as Steele– Richardson–Olszewski syndrome), a parkinsonism-plus syndrome. PSP typically has onset in the seventh decade of life, later than idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple-system atrophy (MSA). The most prominent feature of this disorder is gait and balance problems, with frequent falls. Eye abnormalities in PSP include restricted vertical gaze, predominantly downward gaze, making going down stairs difficult, particularly when combined with the involuntary neck hyperextension (retrocollis) that occurs. The downward gaze restriction can be overcome by the oculocephalic maneuver. Examination often reveals square-wave jerks and impaired optokinetic nystagmus. Other parkinsonian features including bradykinesia, rigidity, micrographia, and gait freezing also occur. MRI of the brain in PSP may show atrophy of the midbrain, leading to the so-called hummingbird sign. Unlike in idiopathic PD, falling in PSP occurs within 1.5 years of symptom onset, whereas in idiopathic PD, it typically occurs years after symptom onset. The prominent vertical gaze abnormalities also help distinguish PSP from idiopathic PD. Also unlike in idiopathic PD, the parkinsonian manifestations in PSP are typically less asymmetric, and response to levodopa is poor. Absence of autonomic features and/or ataxia distinguishes PSP from MSA (discussed in questions 18 and 19). In addition, patients with MSA typically have forward neck flexion (antecollis), as opposed to 517 patients with PSP who have retrocollis. PSP is a neurodegenerative disorder, and is a tauopathy, marked by abnormal deposition of the protein tau in various brain regions. In primary autonomic failure (discussed in Chapter 10 ), parkinsonian features and extraocular movement abnormalities are absent. Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (discussed in question 20) does not manifest with prominent extraocular movement abnormalities (though eye movement abnormalities can occur) or early frequent falls, and is prominently asymmetric, unlike the case described.

      "explicacao": "Both the patients depicted in questions 18 and 19 have multiple- system atrophy (MSA), a parkinsonism-plus syndrome. MSA has been divided into three types on the basis of the most prominent features: with significant autonomic dysfunction (MSA-A, previously known as Shy–Drager syndrome or Oppenheimer’s syndrome, as depicted in question 18), with significant parkinsonism (MSA-P), and with cerebellar ataxia being the most prominent feature (MSA-C, also known as sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy [OPCA], depicted in question 19). However, these may occur in combination. All these disorders share in common the presence of parkinsonism that is poorly responsive to levodopa and the neuropathologic finding of glial cytoplasmic inclusions with α-synuclein; they therefore fall under the spectrum of α-synucleinopathies, along with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). MSA has an earlier age of onset as compared to progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), typically starting in the sixth decade of life. Autonomic dysfunction in MSA manifests with orthostatic hypotension without a compensatory increase in heart rate, urinary incontinence (due to involvement of the group of anterior horn cells in the sacral cord known as Onuf’s nucleus) and impotence. A potentially fatal feature that may occur in MSA is laryngeal dystonia. 518 Imaging features in MSA include hypointensity of the putamen on T2-weighted MRI, a hyperintense slit-like rim around the putamen, and the “hot-cross-buns sign,” or cruciform sign: transverse and vertical hyperintensity in the pons, as shown in Figure 6.1 , due to loss of pontine neurons and pontocerebellar tracts with intact corticospinal tracts. Poor response to levodopa, early autonomic dysfunction, and prominent ataxia distinguish the different types of MSA from idiopathic PD. Prominent early falls and restricted downward gaze distinguish PSP from MSA; as mentioned in question 17, patients with PSP have hyperextension of the neck (retrocollis), whereas patients with MSA exhibit involuntary neck flexion (antecollis). In primary autonomic failure (discussed in Chapter 10 ), parkinsonian features are absent. Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration is discussed in question 20; the prominent dysautonomia in question 18 and ataxia in question 19 make MSA more likely. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

Other features include a frontal/subcortical pattern of cognitive dysfunction, apraxia, alien limb phenomena, and parkinsonian features such as rest tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. There are several causes to CBS: several neurodegenerative disorders can lead to CBS. The original cases of CBS reported were due to corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (CBD), which is pathologically characterized by deposition of phosphorylated tau and neuronal degeneration in the pre- and postcentral cortical areas, basal ganglia, and thalamus, as well as the substantia nigra. 519 Achromatic nuclear inclusions are seen in these areas. While CBS is the classic clinical presentation of CBD, CBD can clinically masquerade as several other syndromes. Thus, CBD is only one of the many causes for CBS, and CBS is only one of the several potential clinical presentations of pathologically diagnosed CBD.

      "explicacao": "Manganese toxicity, rather than magnesium toxicity, can lead to parkinsonism. As discussed previously, parkinsonism is the general term applied when bradykinesia, tremor, and/or rigidity are present in a patient, and this term does not imply a specific cause. Many secondary causes of parkinsonism exist. In the 1920s, during the pandemic of encephalitis lethargica or von Economo encephalitis due to the influenza virus, postencephalitic parkinsonism was seen in several patients after recovery from the acute illness. It has also been seen in more recent years with West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus infection. Parkinsonism may also be a feature of the prion disease CJD. Vascular parkinsonism results most often from multiple lacunes in the basal ganglia. It classically affects the lower extremities more than the upper extremities, with rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, dementia, corticospinal findings, and incontinence occurring. The upper extremities are often relatively spared in this disorder, and tremor is not a prominent feature. Some patients with vascular parkinsonism respond to levodopa therapy. Drug-induced parkinsonism is most often seen with exposure to antipsychotic agents, with typical antipsychotics such as 520 haloperidol being more likely to cause this adverse effect as compared to atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone. This adverse effect is dose dependent and the risk increases with increasing duration of therapy, but can occur even with low-dose brief exposure. Manganese toxicity can occur in welders and miners, in chronic liver disease, and in patients on total parenteral nutrition, among other causes. It leads to psychiatric symptoms (“manganese madness”), parkinsonism (but usually without tremor), and a typical gait disorder characterized by toe walking with elbow flexion, the so-called cock walk. On brain MRI, hyperintensity in the basal ganglia on T1-weighted images is seen. Other toxins that can lead to parkinsonism include the neurotoxin abbreviated as MPTP (which is now used to create primate animal models of Parkinson’s disease) and carbon monoxide (which leads to relatively selective toxicity to the globus pallidus interna). Parkinsonism can be a feature of normal-pressure hydrocephalus (discussed in Chapter 12 ) and other causes of chronic hydrocephalus. Structural brain lesions affecting the basal ganglia, including strokes, hemorrhages, and tumors, can also lead to parkinsonism, as can paraneoplastic processes.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination, including her family history, are consistent with essential tremor (ET). ET is characterized by a bilateral (though sometimes asymmetric) postural tremor, typically 4 to 8 Hz with or without a kinetic component (a tremor occurring with action) that may involve the limbs, head, chin, lips, tongue, and even voice. A family history of 521 tremor is present in the majority of patients with ET; ET exhibits an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with high penetrance. Although there is this strong familial component, a specific gene causing ET is yet to be identified (at the time of the publication of this book), though an association with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the LINGO1 gene has been demonstrated. The tremor of ET classically improves with alcohol intake. Similar to most movement disorders, it does not continue in sleep (though there are exceptions, discussed in question 41). Enhanced physiologic tremor is one of the most common causes of postural tremor, but rarely causes enough disability to require treatment. It is faster than ET, 7 to 12 Hz. Both ET and enhanced physiologic tremor increase with anxiety, but in enhanced physiologic tremor, the frequency is variable and can be slowed by mass loading (increasing weight on the arm). The presence of family history also makes ET more likely than enhanced physiologic tremor. There is no mention of abnormal posturing to suggest this patient has dystonia with secondary tremor (dystonic tremor). Task-specific tremor is a tremor only occurring, as the name implies, with specific tasks, such as writing or playing of musical instruments. There is no such history presented in the case. Another type of tremor is rubral tremor, also known as Holmes tremor, which is a relatively low-frequency tremor typically present at rest, with posture, and with action. It results from lesions in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and/or the superior cerebellar peduncle, and is often seen in patients with multiple sclerosis. First line agents for the treatment of ET include the β-blocker propranolol and primidone (an anticonvulsant which is converted into phenylethylmalonamide [PEMA] and phenobarbital). Other treatments that have less evidence to support their use include other β-blockers such as atenolol, the antiepileptic agents topiramate and gabapentin, and benzodiazepines including clonazepam. Often, combinations of these therapies are necessary. In pharmacotherapy-resistant cases in which the tremor is disabling, deep brain stimulation to the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus can be effective. Although ethanol intake does improve the tremor in ET, it is not an appropriate long-term 522 therapy. Levodopa is not an effective therapy for ET. For the patient depicted in question 22, topiramate is likely the best option, as propranolol will exacerbate her asthma, and given her occupation, a sedating medication such as clonazepam would be relatively contraindicated.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with Tourette’s syndrome. Tourette’s syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosed in the setting of at least one motor and at least one phonic tic that occur at some time during the illness (though not necessarily within the same time period) beginning prior to age 18. A tic is a brief and intermittent stereotypic movement (motor tic) or sound (phonic or vocal tic) that is usually preceded by a premonitory sensation. Tourette’s syndrome is associated with a variety of behavioral and psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, depression and other mood disorders, impulse control disorders, and others. Presence of these comorbidities in a patient with an otherwise typical history and examination consistent with Tourette’s would not necessarily prompt evaluation for other causes. The pathophysiology of Tourette’s syndrome is complex and not fully understood, but it is thought to involve dopaminergic hyper-stimulation of the ventral striatum and limbic system. An important part of tic management is education of the patient, 523 family, teachers, and peers. Treatment of tics is necessary only when they cause significant social or functional impairment. Nonpharmacologic treatment options include a variety of behavioral therapies, including habit-reversal therapy in which the patient is trained to reenact the tics while increasing his/her own awareness of the tics and urges in addition to other components. The mainstay of therapy for Tourette’s syndrome and other tic disorders are antidopaminergic agents such as haloperidol, pimozide, and the atypical antipsychotics. Clonidine, an α-2- adrenergic agonist, is useful for the treatment of ADHD and other behavioral aspects of Tourette’s syndrome, and improves tics as well. Levodopa would not be the first line of management in Tourette’s syndrome, as it may exacerbate tics (though some of the dopamine agonists have been shown in some studies to improve tics, possibly through reduction of endogenous dopamine turnover by action on D 2 autoreceptors). As mentioned, this patient’s constellation of tics and their duration allows for the diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome; when only motor or phonic tics are present and/or their duration is not sufficient enough to make the diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome, the tics are further categorized on the basis of their qualities. Tics that are classified as simple motor consist of a simple isolated movement such as eye blinking or eyebrow raising. Complex motor tics on the other hand consist of coordinated sequenced movements that resemble normal movements such as truncal flexion or head shaking. Simple phonic tics include sniffing, throat clearing, grunting, or coughing. Complex phonic tics include verbalizations such as shouting obscenities (coprolalia), or repeating others (echolalia) or oneself (palilalia). Secondary tourettism is the term given to conditions in which phonic and motor tics are present but an underlying neurologic disorder accounts for the presence of tics; for example, secondary tourettism is seen in autistic spectrum disorders, static encephalopathy, neuroacanthocytosis (discussed in question 33), Huntington’s disease (discussed in questions 30 and 31), medications, and other causes. Transient tics have occurred in some patients following infections. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M. Principles and Practice of Movement 524 Disorders. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2011.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and MRI findings are consistent with Wilson’s disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from mutations of the gene encoding the copper- transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B) on chromosome 13. This enzyme normally binds to and transports copper across membranes. A defect in this enzyme leads to inability to excrete copper from the liver into bile, leading to copper accumulation. The presenting symptoms of the disorder can be neurologic, hepatic, or psychiatric, or a combination of these. Abnormal movements predominate the neurologic presentation, including parkinsonism, dystonia, tremor, ataxia, as well as dysarthria. The tremor may have a variety of features, but classically, it is proximal and of high amplitude, giving the appearance of “wing beating” when the arms are abducted and the elbows flexed. A characteristic grin with drooling also occurs. Psychiatric symptoms include depression, anxiety, and less commonly psychosis. The liver disease may range from mild to fulminant hepatic failure. Laboratory findings in Wilson’s disease include reduced serum levels of the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin and increased urinary excretion of copper. The presence of Kayser–Fleischer rings, resulting from copper deposits in Descemet’s membrane of the cornea, also aids in the diagnosis, and patients suspected of having Wilson’s disease should be referred for slit-lamp examination. MRI of the brain shows increased signal on T2- weighted images in the caudate and putamen as seen in Figure 6.2 , as well as the midbrain (with sparing of the red nucleus, leading to the so-called “double panda sign” or “face of the giant panda”) and thalamus. The treatment of Wilson’s disease includes D-penicillamine or 525 trientine dihydrochloride, in addition to zinc supplementation (which binds copper in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing its absorption), and a low copper diet, including avoidance of nuts, chocolate, and shellfish.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination suggest that she has Huntington’s disease, an autosomal dominant disorder due to expansion of the trinucleotide repeat CAG in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4. Age of onset shows anticipation (earlier age of onset in subsequent generations). The classic clinical features include chorea, gait instability, dystonia, and multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction, executive dysfunction, and personality changes. Other features include motor impersistence, demonstrated by inability of the patient to sustain tongue protrusion and impaired saccades and pursuits, with insuppressible head movements during eye movements. In some forms, particularly the juvenile form, chorea is absent and the more prominent features are myoclonus and parkinsonism, with significant rigidity (akinetic-rigid syndrome). In Huntington’s disease, neuronal degeneration is seen in the striatum, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and other areas. MRI of the brain shows caudate and putamen atrophy. The exact role of the Huntington protein in the pathophysiology of Huntington’s disease is unclear. Several therapies are under investigation to alter the course of the disease, but until they become available, symptomatic treatment with antidopaminergic agents (such as atypical antipsychotics and tetrabenazine) is the mainstay of therapy. When taking a history and examining a patient with abnormal movements, and in the setting of prior psychiatric history and exposure to antidopaminergic therapy, it is important not to 526 attribute the abnormal movements to a tardive phenomenon (discussed in question 35), especially when other features are present that may suggest that there is an underlying disorder leading to the psychiatric symptoms, as is the case in the patient presented in question 30. The prominent chorea, motor impersistence, history of similar illness in the father, and no mention of hepatic dysfunction make Wilson’s disease less likely (discussed in question 28). A psychogenic disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion and there are several features in the history to suggest Huntington’s disease. Benign hereditary chorea in adulthood is not accompanied by neuropsychiatric changes; it is discussed in question 32. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Sydenham’s disease is best treated with antidopaminergic therapies. Chorea is an involuntary, rapid, and abrupt irregular movement that flows from one body part to another. It may affect any body part, and when affecting the legs and trunks, it leads to a dancing- like gait. There are several causes of chorea. Sydenham’s disease is an autoimmune disorder manifesting with chorea that is usually bilateral but often asymmetric, as well as oculomotor abnormalities and behavioral changes following infection with group A Streptococcus. Unlike other features of rheumatic fever, the chorea can present months after the infection or may be the sole manifestation of rheumatic fever. Patients may have elevated antistreptolysin antibodies and antibasal ganglia antibodies but these are neither sensitive nor specific. Treatment of the acute streptococcal infection, as well as subsequent prophylaxis with penicillin in patients who develop rheumatic fever, is essential. Chorea occurring during pregnancy does not necessarily imply a genetic etiology; it may signify prior rheumatic fever or an underlying autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see Chapter 16 ). It may also reflect an underlying 527 antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Benign hereditary chorea is an autosomal dominant nonprogressive syndrome characterized predominantly by chorea, with mild gait ataxia. It results from a mutation in the thyroid transcription factor gene. Mutations in this gene also lead to a more severe childhood syndrome characterized by mental retardation, hypothyroidism, and lung disease (so-called brain– thyroid–lung syndrome).

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination are consistent with chorea- acanthocytosis, one of the neuroacanthocytosis syndromes. The syndrome of neuroacanthocytosis is typically marked by a mixed movement disorder often including dystonia and chorea. Laboratory findings include presence of acanthocytes (spiculated red blood cells) on wet mount blood smear. There are several etiologies of neuroacanthocytosis, including chorea-acanthocytosis, Mcleod’s syndrome (an X-linked disorder resulting from mutations in the Kell group antigen), abetalipoproteinemia, and some of the neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) syndromes which are discussed in question 63. Age of onset of chorea-acanthocytosis is usually in the third to fourth decades of life. The most prominent clinical features are orolingual dystonias, such as prominent tongue-protrusion dystonia, particularly while eating, self-mutilating behavior, cognitive decline with dementia, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, parkinsonism, seizures, and behavioral problems. Chorea and athetosis (a slow form of chorea) also occur. Chorea-acanthocytosis is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the VPS13A gene on chromosome 9 that encodes for the chorein protein. A form of neuroacanthocytosis associated with abetalipoproteinemia is associated with low serum cholesterol and vitamin E malabsorption, not present in this case. Another syndrome along this spectrum, but with normal vitamin E levels, is 528 hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and pallidal degeneration (HARP syndrome). Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is a neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder resulting from expansion of the trinucleotide repeat CAG on chromosome 12. It is more common in people of Asian descent. It typically begins in the fourth decade of life, but earlier onset forms exist. Clinical features include myoclonus, choreoathetosis (a combination of chorea and athetosis), epilepsy, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, and cognitive dysfunction. Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from a mutation in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), leading to abnormal purine metabolism. Hyperuricemia with nephrolithiasis, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and abnormal movements including chorea, athetosis, and rigidity occur. Self-mutilation is also a feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, but the normal serum uric acid and prominent tongue- protrusion dystonia make neuroacanthocytosis more likely. Huntington’s disease is on the differential diagnosis of patients with a presentation similar to that described in question 33, but the prominent tongue dystonia and self-mutilation make chorea- acanthocytosis more likely. A normal uric acid level and the prominent tongue dystonia make Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (discussed in Chapter 14 ) less likely; self-mutilation is seen in both of these disorders.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "The history of the patient depicted in this question is most consistent with tardive dyskinesia. This disorder is an iatrogenic, typically late (hence the term tardive), adverse effect of dopamine- receptor antagonists, most commonly antipsychotics, but also seen with other therapies such as metoclopramide. It is more likely to occur with typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol and fluphenazine because of their greater antagonism at D 2 receptors, but can also occur with the atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, with clozapine and quetiapine being least likely to cause tardive dyskinesia. It may occur during therapy with dopamine-receptor antagonists or even years after the medication is discontinued. The manifestations of tardive dyskinesia include oro-bucco-lingual movements (as in this case), akathisia (inner restlessness), dystonia (often of the neck but also other body parts), tremor, parkinsonism, or a combination of these. Abrupt cessation of a dopamine-receptor antagonist after prolonged use can lead to prominent involuntary dyskinetic movements involving various regions of the body as well as akathisia. A slow taper of the offending agent is therefore recommended when tardive dyskinesia occurs. When psychosis or other indications for dopamine-receptor antagonists persist, switching to an agent with less D 2 antagonism should be attempted when possible. The treatments for tardive dyskinesia include clonazepam and the dopamine-depleting agent tetrabenazine. The rationale behind use of tetrabenazine is that it reduces dopaminergic synaptic activity without causing dopamine-receptor antagonism. Some evidence also exists for use of amantadine. In pharmacotherapy-refractory cases, deep brain stimulation may be 530 considered though high-level evidence for its utility is lacking. Anticholinergics and antihistamines can worsen tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia should be distinguished from an acute dystonic reaction after administration of dopamine-receptor antagonists. This reaction typically occurs within the first few days of exposure to the agent and most often involves the ocular and face muscles, leading to oculogyric crisis (forced eye deviation) and other dystonic manifestations. Treatment involves cessation of the agent and administration of anticholinergics or antihistamines, with resolution of the dystonic reaction within hours. Bhidayasiri R, Fahn S, Weiner WJ, et al.

      "explicacao": "Dystonia is a sustained contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, leading to abnormal postures with repetitive twisting movements. Dystonia is classified as focal when it involves a single body part, as in cervical dystonia. If the dystonia spreads to a contiguous body part, it is termed segmental. Generalized dystonia refers to involvement of at least two segmental regions (such as leg plus trunk) with at least one other body part involved. Multifocal dystonia is used to describe the occurrence of dystonia in two noncontiguous body parts, such as foot and hand. Primary generalized dystonia (also known as Oppenheim’s dystonia or dystonia musculorum deformans), depicted in question 36, is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a mutation in the torsin A gene on chromosome 9, and referred to as DYT1 dystonia. It is more common in those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and has relatively low penetrance. Symptoms typically begin in childhood with action-induced limb dystonia that later spreads to involve the trunk and other limbs, with generalization of the dystonia over a few years. In some patients, the dystonia remains 531 focal. Response to levodopa is typically poor, and a lack of response obviously does not necessarily imply a psychogenic disorder. Treatment of primary generalized dystonia includes anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus interna. Dopa-responsive dystonia (discussed in question 38) shows a good response to levodopa. There are no parkinsonian features to suggest juvenile Parkinson’s disease. Several genes have been associated with dystonia. DYT11, or myoclonus-dystonia syndrome, results from a mutation in a sarcoglycan protein (though other mutated genes have been identified). It is phenotypically heterogeneous but typically manifests with tremor, myoclonus, and dystonia typically beginning in the teenage years and associated with various psychiatric symptoms. DYT3 dystonia, or Lubag disease, is X-linked and is seen in males of Filipino descent and manifests with dystonia and parkinsonism. THAP-1 (DYT6) mutations, are most often associated with adult-onset craniocervical dystonia with laryngeal involvement.

GCH1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, which is a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of dopamine synthesis. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency can lead to a phenotype of dopa-responsive dystonia, but is a more severe childhood dystonia 533 syndrome.

Although the dystonia may overflow to involve more proximal areas over time during specific activities, it is unlikely that she will develop a generalized dystonia given her age. The most common task-specific dystonia is writer’s cramp, a dystonia occurring during writing. This type of dystonia, occurring only with specific activities, is most often primary, without an underlying secondary cause. It most often occurs after the activity is performed for some time. This type of dystonia can occur during playing of various musical instruments; in horn or woodwind players, embouchure dystonia, or dystonia of the lips, jaw, or tongue can be seen. Treatment may include focal injections of botulinum toxin in a manner that minimizes the dystonia, but also minimizes impact on musical performance. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "The description of the jerks seen in the patient depicted in question 40 suggests that he has myoclonus. Not all jerks seen following cerebral anoxia are epileptic. The following discussion of myoclonus is limited to nonepileptic myoclonus (see Chapter 5 for 534 discussion of epileptic myoclonus). Myoclonus is a brief, sudden, jerky movement that may be either generalized (involving the whole body at once in a single jerk), multifocal (involving different body parts, not necessarily all at once), segmental or focal (involving only one region of the body). Cortical myoclonus is the term given to myoclonus resulting from abnormal activity in the sensorimotor cortex. A cortical discharge preceding this type of myoclonus can be detected by electrophysiologic techniques that involve back-averaging. Lance–Adams syndrome, depicted in this case, manifests after hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, and may not be evident for months or even years after the insult. The most prominent feature is action myoclonus, and when the myoclonus involves the legs, gait is prominently affected. Spinal cord ischemia is not thought to be directly involved in the pathophysiology of this type of myoclonus. Treatment includes benzodiazepines such as clonazepam, piracetam, levetiracetam, as well as sodium valproate. Myoclonus may also have subcortical and brainstem origin, as well as spinal cord origin, the latter resulting in either segmental myoclonus (restricted to a specific limb or area of the trunk) or propriospinal myoclonus (involving axial muscles). Nerve root or peripheral nerve lesions can rarely result in segmental myoclonus as well. Multifocal myoclonus is often seen in the context of a variety of metabolic disorders such as uremia and liver failure; in the latter, negative myoclonus or asterixis is seen. Not all myoclonus is pathologic; physiologic myoclonus includes hypnic jerks, which are hypnagogic lower extremity jerks (occurring in the early stages of sleep) and hiccups.

The contractions may also involve other head regions. Palatal contractions as depicted in this case may be essential (without a discernible cause; in some cases thought to be psychogenic) or symptomatic, due to a brainstem lesion such as stroke or tumor. The symptomatic form is one of the few movement disorders that persist during sleep. When involuntary palatal contractions occur in the context of brainstem lesions, the pathophysiology is thought to result from dysfunction in pathways connecting the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, the inferior olive, and the red nucleus, all of which make up the Guillain–Mollaret triangle.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Blepharospasm typically involves both eyes and does not involve the cheek and mouth (discussed in question 37). This patient’s history is consistent with hemifacial spasm, in which there are synchronous contractions of one side of the face. Some cases can occur after facial nerve paresis or due to identifiable compressive lesions of cranial nerve VII such as a tumor or a vascular loop. Contractions most often begin around the eye and spread to ipsilateral face muscles; bilateral involvement is rare but can occur, though contractions on each side of the face are asynchronous. Treatment may involve nerve decompression if there is a clear compressive lesion, but botulinum toxin therapy is otherwise the mainstay of treatment. Although an identifiable structural cause is usually not seen on 536 imaging, this disorder is hypothesized to occur due to a demyelinating lesion in the facial nerve that leads to abnormal spontaneous discharges, with ephaptic transmission or spread of electrical discharges between adjacent fibers of a demyelinated nerve. Because the blink reflex test (the electrophysiologic equivalent of the corneal reflex) is abnormal in patients with hemifacial spasm, another theory is that this disorder results from hyperexcitability in the facial nerve nucleus.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias (PKDs). There are several categories of paroxysmal dyskinesias, all sharing in common episodes of hyperkinetic abnormal movements with intervening normalcy. The abnormal movements may include dystonia, chorea or choreoathetosis, ballism, or dysarthria. These disorders differ in the length of the paroxysm, triggers for the episodes, pharmacologic therapy, and genetics. PKD is characterized by episodes that last seconds to at most 5 minutes, precipitated by sudden movement as well as by startle and hyperventilation. PKD may be either familial or sporadic. Families have been reported that have both PKD and infantile convulsions with choreoathetosis; in some such families mutations in the PRRT2 gene have been identified. Secondary forms of PKD occur in multiple sclerosis, following trauma, in patients with a history of perinatal hypoxic encephalopathy, and in the setting of other underlying neurologic disorders. The primary form responds well to anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine. In paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), attacks last 2 minutes to several hours, and there are sometimes no clear precipitants, although episodes can be aggravated by alcohol, caffeine, and fatigue. Episodes are less frequent than in PKD. PNKD does not typically respond to anticonvulsants. Mutations in the myofibrillogenesis regular (MR-1) gene have been reported in some patients with PNKD. A third form of paroxysmal dyskinesias is referred to as paroxysmal exertional dyskinesias (PED), in which episodes are triggered by prolonged exercise and last typically 5 to 30 minutes but sometimes up to 2 hours. One genetic etiology of PED is mutations in the glucose-1 transporter (GLUT-1) gene. CSF hypoglycorrhachia may be seen in such patients, and treatment with ketogenic diet may help reduce the frequency of episodes. Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesias were previously thought to be nonepileptic dyskinesias but are now known to be frontal lobe seizures as part of the syndrome autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, which results from mutations in the nicotinic 538 acetylcholine receptor, among other genetic mutations. The paroxysmal dyskinesias are not epileptic, but there is an association between PKD or PNKD and epilepsy as discussed above. Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with episodic ataxia type II (EAII). The episodic ataxias are a group of disorders that are categorized on the basis of clinical and genetic differences. They may be familial or sporadic. Episodic ataxia type I (EAI) is marked by episodes of ataxia in association with facial twitching that may be myokymia (rippling muscle movements) or neuromyotonia. These attacks occur up to several times per day, last seconds to minutes, and may be triggered by startle, movement, or exercise. This disorder is due to a mutation in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNA1 on chromosome 12. These episodes may respond to anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, in some cases. In EAII, the episodes of ataxia may be associated with brainstem symptoms such as nystagmus and dysarthria; facial twitching does not occur. The episodes last minutes to hours, can occur daily to monthly, and may be triggered by stress and alcohol intake. EAII results from a mutation in the calcium channel CACN1A4, the same gene mutated in familial hemiplegic migraine, and many patients with EAII have migraines during or outside of the ataxia attacks. EAII episodes may respond to the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide. Episodic ataxia type III is an autosomal dominant disorder in which the attacks of ataxia are associated with tinnitus and vertigo, and in between attacks myokymia occurs. These attacks respond to acetazolamide. In episodic ataxia type IV, episodes of ataxia are associated with ocular motion abnormalities, and the attacks may 539 be triggered by sudden head movement. The genes for these two types of episodic ataxia have yet to be identified (at the time this book was being written). Fahn S, Jankovic J, Hallett M.

The limbs later become involved. Superimposed spasms in response to anxiety or excitement occur, as does an exaggerated startle response. This disorder may be autoimmune, in association with glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. GAD catalyzes the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. In patients with anti-GAD antibodies, insulin-dependent diabetes and other endocrinopathies may occur as well. More focal forms of the disorder, as in stiff leg syndrome, also occur. Stiff person syndrome may also be paraneoplastic in association with antiamphiphysin antibodies.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Cerebellar hemisphere lesions lead to ipsilateral clinical signs. The cerebellum consists of two cerebellar hemispheres, a midline vermis, and several deep gray nuclei interspersed among the cerebellar white matter. The cerebellar cortex consists of three layers. The molecular layer is outermost and consists of inhibitory neurons known as stellate and basket cells. Purkinje cells lie in a layer under these neurons, and are the main output of the cerebellum to the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. The main neurotransmitter of Purkinje cells is GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The innermost layer is the granular layer, and consists of granule cells and Golgi interneurons. Parallel fibers, axons of the granule cells, travel to synapse with Purkinje cells. Granule cells are the only cerebellar cell types that are excitatory. Inhibitory fibers arise from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and project to the deep cerebellar nuclei. Fibers arising from the deep cerebellar nuclei, including the dentate, emboliform, and globose nuclei, are excitatory and are carried through the superior cerebellar peduncle, decussate, and then synapse in the thalamus. The thalamus in turn projects to the cortex, which in turn projects back to the brainstem through the corticobulbar, corticospinal, and other descending pathways. Because the fibers from the cerebellum 541 to the thalamus cross, and motor fibers from the cortex ultimately cross (in the decussation of the corticospinal tract in the pyramids), lesions to one cerebellar hemisphere lead to ipsilateral cerebellar signs and symptoms. Afferents into the cerebellum are carried through the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncle (note that the superior cerebellar peduncle carries predominantly cerebellar efferents, though it carries afferents to the cerebellum as well). These afferents include axons of the spinocerebellar tract, which are termed mossy fibers, as well as projections from the pons, vestibular nuclei, and reticular nuclei. Another main afferent pathway to the cerebellum arises from the inferior olivary nucleus and travels in the form of climbing fibers around Purkinje cells. The clinical features of cerebellar dysfunction include ataxia, dysmetria (uncoordinated movement with under- or overshooting of target), dysdiadochokinesia (impaired rapid alternating movements), hypometric or hypermetric saccades (under- or overshooting of eye movements to a target, respectively), hypotonia, and rebound (inability to control the extent of movement particularly when resistance is released).

In a patient with ataxia of unclear etiology, celiac antibodies should be checked as in some cases with gluten enteropathy, gluten-free diet can improve the ataxia (discussed also in Chapter 16 ). There are several causes of acquired cerebellar ataxia. Hypothyroidism can lead to gait ataxia, and checking serum thyroid–stimulating hormone is indicated in an adult presenting with ataxia. Supplementation with thyroid hormone can lead to improvement of the gait disorder. Chemotherapeutic agents including 5-fluorouracil and cytarabine can lead to significant cerebellar toxicity. In cytarabine toxicity, Purkinje cell loss and gliosis occur, and there is loss of dentate neurons as well; the cerebellar dysfunction is typically irreversible. Metals such as mercury can lead to cerebellar toxicity as well as visual cortex toxicity, leading to a syndrome of ataxia, visual field deficits, and paresthesias. Bismuth salicylate can also lead to cerebellar toxicity if ingested in high amounts. Other cerebellar toxins include the solvent toluene. Chronic intake of phenytoin can lead to cerebellar atrophy due to damage to Purkinje cells. Acute phenytoin toxicity can lead to reversible cerebellar ataxia.

High-arched feet and spinal deformities occur. Cardiac involvement is common, including cardiac conduction abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It most often presents in young adulthood, but presentation in early childhood or even late adulthood may occur. FA results from an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat GAA in the frataxin gene on chromosome 9. The exact role of frataxin is unclear, but it is thought to be a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein. Idebenone, a synthetic coenzyme Q10 analogue, improves the cardiomyopathy in FA.

      "explicacao": "The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of ataxias that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Most common forms are 544 autosomal dominant. Repeat expansions are common to many of them, with the CAG repeat most often expanded, but other repeats of different lengths have been identified on different chromosomes, as have been point mutations and other genetic abnormalities. The pathophysiology of the SCAs resulting from repeat expansion is thought to relate to a toxic gain of function, leading to a protein product that is misfolded and abnormally aggregates. The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) typically present in the third to fifth decades of life, but can present at any age, with each of the SCAs having a different mean age of onset. Although clinically heterogeneous, they share in common the occurrence of a progressive truncal and limb ataxia, often with associated spasticity and other upper motor neuron findings. Other abnormalities depending on the subtype include impaired saccades and smooth pursuits, cranial nerve abnormalities, and in some cases neuropathy. In some of the SCAs, epilepsy and cognitive decline occur. In SCA7, there is retinopathy with vision loss. MRI of the brain shows cerebellar atrophy and in some cases, atrophy of the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. The most common spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is SCA3, also known as Machado–Joseph disease. Like SCA1 and SCA2, age of onset is typically in the third to fourth decades of life, though wide variability again occurs. In addition to ataxia and other cerebellar signs, facial and tongue atrophy and fasciculations occur, and bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia are common. Levodopa- responsive parkinsonism may occur. Neuropathy is a late feature. SCA3 results from expansion of the CAG repeat in the gene ataxin 3 on chromosome 14. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme 27-sterol hydroxylase on chromosome 2, which results in deposition of cholesterol and cholestanol in a variety of tissues, including the brain, lungs, lens of the eye, and tendons. This results in a variety of clinical manifestations in multiple organ systems, including neuropsychiatric symptoms (cognitive decline, personality changes, and psychiatric symptoms), ataxia (in the limbs and trunk), parkinsonism, neuropathy, tendon xanthomas particularly in the Achilles tendon, diarrhea, and cataracts. Diagnosis is made by measurement of serum cholestanol; serum cholesterol is often not elevated and not helpful in making the diagnosis. MRI of the brain shows cortical and cerebellar atrophy and white matter abnormalities. Treatment includes chenodeoxycholic acid as a means of lowering serum cholestanol; long-term therapy may lead to improvement in neurologic signs and symptoms.

Symptoms include unsteadiness or shakiness on standing, with improvement when given physical support or with ambulation. The gait disorder is not described as magnetic or apraxic, and there is no history of incontinence or cognitive decline to suggest normal-pressure hydrocephalus (discussed in Chapter 12 ). Unfortunately, patients with orthostatic tremor may be misdiagnosed with psychogenic gait disorder because the tremor may not be visible on examination, though it is most often detectable by surface EMG.

The differential diagnosis of hyperdense lesions on CT scan does include hemorrhage, but given the time course of this patient’s symptoms as well as the symmetry and density of the lesions on CT 547 scan (being comparable to that of the bone), calcium deposition is more likely. Although small basal ganglia calcifications are an incidental imaging finding of little clinical significance in most patients, the extent of calcification seen on this patient’s CT scan combined with the history and examination findings suggest that this is clinically relevant and likely contributing to his parkinsonism. The distribution of calcium deposition includes most often the caudate, but also putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum, among other areas. Striopallidodentate calcinosis can be idiopathic, but can also be seen in both autosomal dominant and recessive familial forms, and a variety of metabolic disorders including secondary hyperparathyroidism as is seen in end-stage renal disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, as well as hypoparathyroidism. Interestingly, one of the genes mutated in familial forms of this disorder, SCL20A2, is involved in phosphorous transport and has been directly implicated in the abnormal calcium phosphate deposition that occurs in brain parenchyma. Another causative gene mutation has been identified in a gene encoding platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGFB), and the proposed mechanism for calcium deposition in such cases has been related to blood–brain barrier disruption.

Although all patients with progressive neurodegenerative disorders should be encouraged to draft advanced directives early on, this should not be a prerequisite to diagnostic testing.

      "explicacao": "The image in Figure 6.5B is consistent with reduced dopamine transporter ligand binding, and given the clinical history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is PD. She may also have comorbid essential tremor (ET), given her lifelong history of tremor. The overlap between ET and PD is controversial and beyond the scope of this text. The case presented is meant to illustrate the utility of ligand-based imaging in diagnosis of parkinsonism in equivocal cases. A commonly used ligand is I123 ioflupane, known in the United States as DaTscan. It is a cocaine analogue and binds to the presynaptic dopamine receptor. This scan therefore assesses presynaptic rather than postsynaptic dopamine transporters (and therefore speaks nothing about the state of the putamen). In the setting of substantia nigra degeneration, there are reduced projections to the striatum and thus less binding of dopamine transporter ligand to presynaptic dopamine transporters in the striatum, leading to the findings in Figure 6.5 . In Figure 6.5A , representative examples of normal I123 ioflupane brain SPECT scan are shown. Crescent-shaped symmetric radiotracer distribution with intensity distinct from background brain is apparent. The scan from the patient presented in question 61 is shown in Figure 6.5B . There is a loss of the crescent shape and decrease in the intensity of radiotracer uptake worse on the left side (images are in radiologic 550 position). This correlates with contralateral clinical symptoms. Additionally, relative to background brain, radiotracer uptake is less robust. When the diagnosis of PD is straightforward on a clinical basis there is likely little advantage in ordering a dopamine transporter SPECT scan, but in equivocal cases of tremor and/or parkinsonism, this can be helpful. Aside from distinguishing PD from essential tremor, other potentially useful indications for this type of scan include differentiating equivocal cases of idiopathic PD from drug- induced parkinsonism and vascular parkinsonism, among others. In regards to the utility of other imaging modalities in PD, fluorodopa PET studies in patients with idiopathic PD show reduced uptake in the putamen. Given the clearcut findings in Figure 6.5B , a fluorodopa PET scan would not be of use in this case. Bajaj N, Hauser RA, Grachev ID.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and imaging finding suggest that he has neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). The NBIAs encompass several disorders that can present with or manifest various movement disorders including parkinsonism (which may be partially levodopa responsive, but with early and at times severe dyskinesias), dystonia, and choreoathetosis. Developmental delay may be present, but not in all cases. Other neurologic manifestations include spasticity, ataxia, and seizures. While they usually present in infancy or childhood, adult-onset cases occur as well. Iron deposition is seen in the globus pallidus as well as other regions (depending on the specific type of NBIA) as detailed below. Iron deposition is best seen on T2*-weighted (gradient-echo [GRE]) and susceptibility weighted images (an example is shown in Fig. 6.7 ). Iron deposition occurs in the globus pallidus with increasing age but age-related iron deposition would not be present in a 13-year-old boy. The differential diagnosis of hypointensity on T2*-weighted imaging includes hemosiderin and calcium. The NBIAs are marked by significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Several of the genes associated with NBIAs are 552 associated with lipid metabolism or iron metabolism. Genetic mutations causative of an NBIA and associated imaging findings are as follows (note the imaging features presented are classic but may be absent or subtle): • Pantothenate-kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN): this is the most common NBIA. Due to mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 gene. Imaging findings include hypointensity of the globus pallidus with a central hyperintensity (so-called eye-of-the-tiger sign, which is suggestive but not pathognomonic), as well as, in some cases, hypointensity of the substantia nigra and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. Iron deposition may be absent or subtle particularly in adult-onset cases. • PLA2G6–associated neurodegeneration (PLAN): due to mutations in a phospholipase gene, PLA2G6, which is also the causative gene for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. Cerebellar atrophy on MRI is prominent in this disorder. • Mitochondrial membrane protein–associated neurodegeneration (MPAN): due to mutations in chromosome 9 open reading frame 12 (C19orf12). On MRI, in addition to iron deposition evident on GRE in the globus pallidus, iron deposition in the substantia nigra may be prominent, and there may be a hyperintense streak-like appearance within the globus pallidus on conventional T2. • Beta-propeller protein–associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) due to mutations in WD repeat domain 45 (WDR45) gene. A T1 halo of hyperintensity surrounding the substantia nigra on T1- weighted imaging suggests this disorder. Psychomotor regression followed by static encephalopathy in childhood, with subsequent relatively abrupt onset of dystonia or other abnormal movements later (in early adulthood) may be seen with BPAN. • Neuroferritinopathy: due to mutations in ferritin light chain. Serum ferritin may be low in some but not all cases. Iron deposition is widespread involving not only the globus pallidus but also cortex, caudate, and putamen. Among the NBIAs, neuroferritinopathy (along with aceruloplasminemia) is more 553 likely than some of the others to present in adulthood. • Aceruloplasminemia: an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene. Caudate, putamen, red nucleus, and thalamic involvement with iron deposition is seen on MRI. Along with neuroferritinopathy, it has a higher average age of onset compared to the other NBIAs. • Fatty-acid hydroxylase–associated neurodegeneration (FAHN): due to mutations in the fatty-acid hydroxylase gene. In addition to iron deposition, white matter changes maybe prominent on MRI in this disorder. • Kufor-Rakeb syndrome: due to mutations in ATP13A2. In addition to the many manifestations of NBIAs described above, oculogyric dystonic spasms and facial-faucial finger mini- myoclonus may be seen, and these findings would suggest this as a potential etiology in the evaluation of a patient with a presumed NBIA. • CoA synthase protein–associated neurodegeneration (CoPAN). While kernicterus, due to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, can lead to bilateral basal ganglia lesions and abnormalities of movement in childhood, the perinatal history presented is not consistent with this and kernicterus would not be associated with the abnormalities on GRE seen in this case, but rather with hyperintensity in the globus pallidus on T2-weighted imaging. Basal ganglia calcifications can lead to abnormalities of movement (as discussed in question 57) and the findings seen in Figure 6.7 , however, calcifications would have been evident on CT scan. Hemosiderin resulting from hemorrhage is on the differential diagnosis of the image seen in Figure 6.7 on GRE, but the clinical history (of a progressive disorder rather than an acute presentation) and symmetric GRE findings make bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages highly unlikely. Finally, in utero basal ganglia infarcts would not be associated with the GRE image findings seen in Figure 6.7 (but rather with encephalomalacia in the affected areas), and the clinical history is not consistent.

      "explicacao": "This patient has relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Most patients with this disorder have onset between age 20 and 40, though age of onset ranges from early childhood to late adulthood. Women are affected more than men in a 2.3:1 ratio. It is more common further north and south from the equator, and more common in Caucasians. It occurs in about 1 in 1,000 people. RRMS is defined by relapses consistent with demyelination, with or without clinical improvement, but with episodes of clinical stability in between relapses. The term “remitting” is confusing as these patients may not return to clinical normalcy after a relapse. In addition, on MRI, they may have new lesion formation 5 to 10 times as often as they have new clinical episodes, while remaining clinically stable. A “relapse” is defined as an episode of new or worsened neurologic symptoms, lasting more than 24 hours, not due to fever or infection. Other synonyms for this are an attack, bout, or exacerbation. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on two relapses separated in time with clinical evidence of multiple lesions in the central nervous system. The diagnosis can also be made on the basis of multiple lesions on the MRI in combination with an appropriate history and examination, new lesion formation on MRI over time, and new clinical activity over time. A clinically isolated syndrome of demyelination is a single clinical episode consistent with demyelination, but no “second episode” to make a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Patients who have a single episode of demyelination who have new MRI lesions (gadolinium enhancing) and old lesions (nonenhancing) may meet criteria for multiple sclerosis using newer diagnostic 576 criteria. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis usually occurs in older patients. These patients have a gradually progressive course from onset and do not have relapses. They may have a lower burden of MRI lesions than do patients with RRMS. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute disorder, more common in childhood, and often occurs soon after an infection or vaccination. Patients with ADEM develop a severe disorder with multifocal demyelination in the brain and spinal cord (see discussion to questions 19 to 21). Fulminant multiple sclerosis indicates a rapidly progressive course with repeated relapses that are refractory to standard treatment. There are no laboratory tests that are presently useful in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. On occasion, other disorders can mimic multiple sclerosis. Diseases commonly tested for in early evaluation of multiple sclerosis include vitamin B 12 deficiency, lupus, Lyme disease in endemic areas, and other inflammatory disorders depending on clinical suspicion. Skin biopsy for small- fiber neuropathy may be useful for patients with paresthesias that affect the limbs and face, that are persistent, and in whom there is no evidence to suggest central demyelination. Somatosensory- evoked, or visual-evoked, potentials may be useful in selected patients to ascertain a second lesion or show slowing, suggestive of central demyelination. Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials can be abnormal in the population with multiple sclerosis, but generally are not helpful diagnostically (insensitive in early multiple sclerosis for subclinical brainstem lesions). CSF may show mild elevation in WBCs, predominantly lymphocytes. Measures of immune activity are sometimes, but not always, abnormal, including immunoglobulin G synthesis rate and the presence of oligoclonal bands (indicating antibody formation in the spinal fluid compartment). The prognosis for RRMS is better than most people expect. Various studies have shown a good prognosis over 10 years in a representative population without treatment. However, neurologic examination shows abnormalities after 10 years of disease in most patients. The diagnosis of benign multiple sclerosis is a retrospective one after 15 to 20 years of disease without measurable disability and cannot be reliably predicted. This occurs 577 in approximately 10% to 20% of patients with multiple sclerosis. Pregnancy does not affect the overall course of multiple sclerosis. Most patients with RRMS will not progress to wheelchair status within 10 years. Fox RJ, Bethoux F, Goldman MD, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient has optic neuritis. The results of a large randomized double-blind treatment trial for acute optic neuritis compared intravenous methylprednisolone with prednisone taper, oral prednisone taper, and placebo. This study showed that recovery was hastened by intravenous methylprednisolone with oral prednisone taper, but visual outcome at 1 year was not significantly affected. Oral steroids were at best no better than placebo, and possibly worse. In about 80% of patients with acute optic neuritis, recovery occurs over 2 to 6 weeks. This may be incomplete. Over a 15-year period after an episode of optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis occurs in about 50% of cases. Factors that increase the risk of multiple sclerosis developing include the presence of brain MRI lesions consistent with demyelination and abnormal CSF findings. In the Optic Neuropathy Treatment Trial, patients with visual acuity of 20/50 or better did not measurably benefit from intravenous steroids treatment. Relative afferent pupillary defect is a sign seen in optic neuritis. In this condition, there is involvement of the optic nerve with impaired response to light stimulation. The afferent arm of the pupillary light reflex is affected, in the side of the optic neuritis as 578 compared to the normal eye. This leads to a relative reduction in signal traveling to the Edinger–Westphal nucleus in the midbrain from the affected eye. Thus, light shone into the affected eye causes a normal consensual light reflex. (Both the pupils constrict.) When the stimulus is shifted to the “good” eye, pupils remain constricted, and then when shifted back to the affected eye, there is relatively less “light,” so the pupils dilate (see also Chapter 1 ). This is not an indication of an effect on the third nerve, which is the efferent arm of the pupillary light reflex. This does not suggest a particular prognosis. This does not imply a meningeal component. MRI of the brain is ordered primarily to assess evidence and risk of progression in multiple sclerosis. On occasion, imaging of the optic nerve can confirm optic nerve involvement, but it is not critical for the diagnosis of optic neuritis. Rarely, retro-orbital or meningeal processes can cause sudden visual loss, simulating optic neuritis. On occasion, sinus cystic disease can cause impingement on or inflammation in the optic nerve. If there are one or more well-defined demyelinating lesions on MRI, the risk of multiple sclerosis goes from about 20% in 5 years to approximately 80% over 5 years. Multiple treatment trials in patients with a single episode of demyelination and MRI brain lesions have shown benefit from starting medicines that are FDA approved for multiple sclerosis treatment in such patients. In general, when the MRI does not show such lesions, treatment is not indicated beyond steroid therapy acutely. Unless the patient has a history suggestive of syphilis, syphilis serology is not useful. Angiotensin-converting enzyme testing is not useful in this situation unless there are other indications to suggest sarcoidosis. Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials are of low yield in this situation. There is no indication for retinal angiography in typical optic neuritis. It may be useful if there are atypical features such as a horizontal scotoma or very sudden painless onset suggesting a vascular etiology. Balcer LJ. Clinical practice. Optic neuritis.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "The patient is having an acute relapse. In this case, there is a functional deficit interfering with walking, which is an indication for treatment rather than conservative management. Intravenous methylprednisolone is usually given as a dose of 1,000 mg daily for 3 to 5 days, with an oral steroid taper, and is the treatment of choice for acute relapses. Other options include other forms of steroids, different dosing or duration of taper, not using a tapering dose, and oral high-dose steroids. The goal of treatment is to reduce the functional deficit and increase the speedy recovery of function. The Babinski sign is elicited by stroking the lateral border of the sole of the foot with a moderately sharp object. A normal response is that the great toe goes down (plantar flexion). A positive Babinski sign is when the great toe goes up, often with fanning of the other toes. A full “triple flexion” response is when the ankle dorsiflexes, the knee flexes, and the hip flexes in addition to the Babinski sign. The presence of a Babinski sign implies dysfunction in the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract between the cortex and the lumbar spinal cord. A positive Babinski sign is an indication of an upper motor neuron disorder (corticospinal tract) and not a lower motor neuron disorder (problem affecting the lower motor neuron from the anterior horn of the spinal cord to the neuromuscular junction). Increased exercise during an acute exacerbation has not been shown to be beneficial. However, regular exercise in multiple sclerosis has been shown to improve quality-of-life measures and reduce fatigue and depression scales. A crossed adductor sign is seen when performing the patellar reflex, as the opposite (crossed) leg adducts (moves medially from the hip). This implies a spread of reflex above the L4 level into L2 and L3 segments of the cord, indicating disinhibition of the reflex arc. This is another upper motor neuron sign. 580 Frohman EM, Shah A, Eggenberger E, et al. Corticosteroids for multiple sclerosis: I. application for treating exacerbations.

      "explicacao": "Multiple sclerosis is more prevalent the further north or south of the equator one lives. The cause for this has not been established. Moving after the age of 12 does not seem to alter this risk. There is no evidence that drinking milk or other dietary measures affect the development of multiple sclerosis. However, various epidemiologic studies suggest a link between vitamin D levels and multiple sclerosis, with lower vitamin D levels being correlated with higher risk of multiple sclerosis. Whether this is related to the cause of multiple sclerosis or common factors is unclear. Monozygotic (identical) female twins have a 33% chance of both being affected by multiple sclerosis if one develops multiple sclerosis. This indicates a mixture of genetic and nongenetic factors in the disease causation. People who have never had mononucleosis are very unlikely to get multiple sclerosis, but 95% of the population has been exposed to mononucleosis. Although mononucleosis has been linked to multiple sclerosis, the relationship is unclear and no definitive pathogenic relationship can be shown at present. The best evidence against environmental transmission of multiple sclerosis comes from adoption studies that do not show an increase in multiple sclerosis in children adopted into multiple sclerosis- affected families. Multiple sclerosis exacerbations are more likely to occur after infections, but are not related to any specific infection. Motor vehicle accidents and surgical procedures have not been linked to the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. Fox RJ, Bethoux F, Goldman MD, et al.

Although the diagnosis of multifocal glioma is in the differential of multicentric lesions in the brain, the relapsing pattern and the presence of an open-ring sign with limited mass effect on the MRI in Figure 7.3 would all argue against this diagnosis. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis appears to be a subform of relapsing multiple sclerosis with large, mass-like lesions. These often have incomplete peripheral enhancement, showing the “open-ring sign,” which is suggestive of this pathology. Patients may improve with intravenous steroids but, on occasion, may require other immunologic treatment such as plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin. The open-ring sign is consistent with tumefactive multiple sclerosis and does not suggest abscess. The prognosis is similar to that seen in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and is not “dismal.” There is no specific evidence that Chlamydia pneumoniae is causative for tumefactive multiple sclerosis.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Typical multiple sclerosis lesions are periventricular and oval shaped. They have increased T2 signal. Characteristically, they are oval shaped and periventricular, but may be irregular, small or large, sharply defined or ill-defined, and may involve subcortical and juxtacortical brain. They may be seen in the infratentorial compartment typically around the fourth ventricle and in the brainstem white matter. They may show T1-reduced signal (so- called black holes). This appears to suggest more significant axonal loss or an older plaque. With gadolinium, some, but not all lesions can enhance. Enhancement of all lesions or persistent enhancement for weeks would be atypical for multiple sclerosis plaques. Spinal cord lesions in multiple sclerosis usually extend only one to two segments of the cord. A longitudinally extensive lesion over three or more segments suggests other disorders such as Devic’s disease (see discussion to questions 14 to 18), transverse myelitis, sarcoidosis, lupus, or an intraspinal mass. Spinal cord lesions may show mass effect acutely, with gradual reduction in mass effect over time and eventual focal atrophy. Some multiple sclerosis lesions can be ill-defined. Some patients have a poorly defined change in brain MRI signal on FLAIR and T2, known as “dirty white matter,” in which cloudy-appearing changes without sharply defined borders are seen. There is an increased detection of focal lesions with increased field strength magnets. This can be very useful for infratentorial lesions that may not be evident with lower-field–strength magnets.

      "explicacao": "584 Neuromyelitis optica (Devic’s disease) is a neuroinflammatory condition with a distinct pathology and clinical course. Histologically, focal areas of demyelination are seen with significant leukocyte infiltration and some areas of frank necrosis and cavitation. There may be nearly complete axon loss within lesions. There are antibodies, neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG), that bind selectively to the aquaporin-4 water channel. This is a component of the dystroglycan-protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood–brain barrier. Lupus myelitis can be acute as well, but patients have other markers of lupus, such as skin rash, arthritis, and renal involvement. Relapsing optic neuritis and myelitis together would be unusual in lupus myelitis. Fulminant multiple sclerosis could cause this syndrome, but the presence of severe optic neuritis bilaterally should suggest the diagnosis of Devic’s disease first. Laboratory testing for NMO-IgG is positive in 70% of such cases. Subacute combined degeneration could cause paresthesias of the feet, but does not cause a relapsing optic neuritis. Neurosarcoidosis can mimic most neurologic disorders, but is usually a diagnosis of exclusion or diagnosed when systemic markers of this disease are present (e.g., skin, lung, and other organ involvement; see Chapter 16 ). Devic’s disease progresses with relapses, but does not tend to progress in between relapses. It can have a monophasic or relapsing course. It is often severe. It can exhibit a spinal form. Relapses are frequently severe and may not recover completely. Treatment is urgent in relapses of Devic’s disease and many of the deficits do not resolve completely. Interferon β does not seem to be effective in Devic’s disease. There are no data on the use of natalizumab in Devic’s disease. Medicines that have been used anecdotally include steroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and other immunosuppressants. For acute exacerbations, IV steroids or plasmapheresis can be used. Early in Devic’s disease, the brain tends to be spared. However, later in the course, it may have some atypical features, with brainstem disease extending up from the spinal cord, lesions atypical for multiple sclerosis in the brain, and imaging findings consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. 585 Lennon VA, Kryzer TJ, Pittock SJ, et al.

It is a multifocal demyelinating syndrome with large lesions that can be peripheral and may involve the basal ganglia. CSF may show a pleocytosis, but usually does not show oligoclonal bands. Patients are often febrile and encephalopathic. It may leave residual deficits. First-line treatment for ADEM is intravenous methylprednisolone. All treatment recommendations are anecdotal. Treatment consists of initial intravenous methylprednisolone and if this fails, a trial of plasmapheresis. There is no indication for antibacterial or antiviral agents to treat this condition. The hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy of Weston Hurst is a severe immune-mediated encephalopathy with areas of hemorrhage often in the temporal lobes. It may be a subform of ADEM. Balo’s concentric sclerosis refers to a progressive demyelinating disorder in which concentric rings of demyelination are seen either pathologically or on MRI. This presentation is not consistent with viral meningitis as the patient has CNS parenchymal findings on MRI. ADEM appears to be a separate neuroimmunologic disorder from multiple sclerosis. However, some patients diagnosed with ADEM later develop a relapsing pattern consistent with multiple sclerosis. 586 This may be due to a tendency in the pediatric population to diagnose ADEM rather than a first episode of multiple sclerosis.

They are similar in effect profile. They vary in side effects, route of administration, and frequency of administration. The interferons as a class cause flu-like symptoms after injections and may cause injection site reactions. They require laboratory monitoring for liver function changes and hematologic abnormalities. Glatiramer acetate causes local injection site reactions and occasional idiosyncratic chest pain. Although all agents reduce attack frequency 30% on average, this varies widely in individuals. None of the agents promote neural repair or cause “improvement” as an outcome. There is no one best choice for treatment. Higher-dose interferons tend to cause neutralizing antibodies in one-third of cases that may interfere with the efficacy of these medicines.

      "explicacao": "Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the cellular adhesion molecule α4-integrin. It binds to lymphocytes and prevents adherence at the endothelial surface of blood vessels in the brain and gut. It therefore reduces the entry of 588 immunologically active cells into the CNS compartment. Trials have shown a 60% to 70% reduction in exacerbation rate, reduced activity on MRI, and slowed progression with the use of this medicine in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In the United States, it is indicated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis usually when patients have failed other forms of disease-modifying therapy. Use of natalizumab requires an FDA-approved monitoring program. There is an approximately 1 in 1,000 risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients on natalizumab. The risk appears to be higher with prior or additional immunosuppressing medicines and after 2 years of continuous use. Patients with positive serum JC virus antibodies are at even higher risk. There are no comparative studies of natalizumab and mitoxantrone in multiple sclerosis. Mitoxantrone has been associated with treatment-related acute leukemia and dose- dependent cardiomyopathy, and rates appear to be high for both of these side effects. Anaphylaxis occurs in about 1 in 50 patients often by the second to fourth dose of natalizumab. Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, hypotension, rash, and tachycardia. The infusion should be stopped immediately if this occurs, and treatment for anaphylaxis should be instituted. This is an absolute contraindication to restarting natalizumab. There is no desensitization procedure, nor should the medicine be retried with premedication or at a lower dose. This is not related to immunoglobulin A deficiency. PML symptoms include aphasia, visual field deficits, headache, hemiparesis, and cognitive dysfunction progressing over weeks. Patients develop focal subcortical lesions in multiple brain areas that can at times be difficult to discriminate from multiple sclerosis lesions. CSF may be positive for JC virus PCR, which is the causative agent for PML. Treatment for PML in this population includes stopping natalizumab as soon as there is a suspicion of PML, checking JC virus PCR, and beginning plasmapheresis to clear residual natalizumab more rapidly from the system.

Spasticity can occur with or without concurrent weakness. It indicates disinhibition of the upper motor neuron pathway. Both baclofen and tizanidine are indicated for multiple sclerosis- related spasticity. They have similar efficacy. Side effects of baclofen include fatigue, dizziness, and dose-related leg weakness at higher doses. Sudden cessation of baclofen may cause withdrawal seizures. Side effects of tizanidine include light- headedness and hypotension, fatigue, and, rarely, liver function changes. There is no evidence that exercise “takes away” spasticity. Judicious stretching and a regular exercise program both are part of spasticity management. For patients in whom medications are ineffective or cause too many side effects, selective botulinum toxin injections may improve symptoms.

They therefore lack the signal necessary for egress from the lymph nodes and secondary lymphoid tissues. In clinical trials, it reduces relapses of multiple sclerosis in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, as well as reduces MRI measures of clinical activity. In addition, there appear to be direct effects on neurons and glial cells, which also express S1P receptors.

In two phase III trials in patients with multiple sclerosis randomized to dalfampridine versus placebo, a significantly greater percentage of patients were “responders” on dalfampridine than on placebo. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed while on therapy than while not on therapy. About one-third patients responded to dalfampridine in these studies. The increased response rate in the dalfampridine group was observed across all four major types of multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing, and primary progressive).

There are a number of interesting epidemiologic observations that suggest there may be a link, but no definite causative association has been proven. Low vitamin D levels are more common further away from the equator, as is the prevalence and incidence of multiple sclerosis. In a large nursing health cohort study, multiple sclerosis was less common in nurses who took vitamin D supplements. African Americans with multiple sclerosis have both lower vitamin D levels than Caucasians and a more severe clinical course. There is no well-defined dose of vitamin D for multiple sclerosis at present. Some trials are under way to 592 further understand this link. Studies in vitro and in animal models have shown a link between vitamin D and the immune system, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect on CD4 T cells and antigen presenting cells, influencing an “anti-inflammatory” function.

      "explicacao": "Dimethyl fumarate is a second generation fumaric acid ester with unclear exact mechanism of action, which may cause gastrointestinal upset and loose bowel movements as well as intermittent flushing. This tends to improve after the first 2 to 3 months on drug. Dimethyl fumarate is a pregnancy category C agent. Teriflunomide inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which plays a role in pyrimidine synthesis. This agent is associated with diarrhea, nausea, elevated liver enzymes, alopecia and may be teratogenic, considered as a pregnancy category X agent. Fingolimod binds to sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptors on lymphocytes, causing internalization and interfering with signals through these receptors, which are necessary for these cells to egress lymph nodes. Fingolimod can cause macular edema and a first dose bradycardia, requiring 6-hour observation after first administration. Other potential side effects include bronchitis and elevation in liver enzymes. Fingolimod has also been associated with the risk of severe (potentially fatal) varicella zoster virus infections. Fingolimod is a pregnancy category C agent. All of the oral agents require laboratory monitoring, including blood counts and liver function testing. Patients being started on fingolimod will require baseline EKG and ophthalmologic examination. Adequate varicella zoster virus immunity is also recommended prior to starting fingolimod.

Diffuse astrocytomas are infiltrating neoplasms and account for 40% of primary brain tumors. Astrocytomas (WHO grade II) are slow- growing tumors that may evolve into an anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III) or glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). In astrocytomas (WHO II) the MRI shows a T2-hyperintense lesion with no enhancement with gadolinium. Fibrillary astrocytomas are prototypical and more common, with elongated hyperchromatic nuclei, scant cytoplasm, and the presence of a fibrillary background. Gemistocytic astrocytomas are characterized by rounded cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm. Protoplasmic astrocytomas are composed of cells with oval-shaped nuclei and wispy cobweb-like processes. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is not a diffuse astrocytoma and is rather a different type of astrocytoma, which is localized superficially, more commonly in the temporal lobe, with well- demarcated borders, and frequently associated with seizures. Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and pilocytic astrocytomas are also well-circumscribed neoplasms and not categorized under the diffuse astrocytomas. Prayson RA. Neuropathology.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "This patient has meningeal carcinomatosis, and these cases are often treated with whole-brain radiation plus intraventricular methotrexate. Certain cancers can spread to the meninges producing 626 carcinomatous meningitis. This can be seen with adenocarcinoma of the breast, lung and gastrointestinal tract, and melanoma. Prostate cancer has been described to spread to the leptomeninges, and this is thought to occur through dissemination via Batson’s plexus, which is a network of valveless veins that connect pelvic veins with internal vertebral veins. The clinical manifestations of leptomeningeal disease are varied, but frequently, these patients present with headache and backache. Polyradiculopathies, multiple cranial neuropathies, and altered mental status are often seen. Some patients have features of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. The MRI shows leptomeningeal enhancement. The diagnosis can be established with CSF studies using cytologic evaluation and flow cytometry. CSF also will show a pleocytosis with increased protein and sometimes reduced glucose. However, CSF cytologic analysis is not sensitive, and many times repeated testing is needed. In some cases, leptomeningeal biopsy may be required. The treatment is radiation therapy to symptomatic areas, often requiring whole-brain radiation. Some cases are treated with intrathecal chemotherapy and, preferably, intraventricular chemotherapy with methotrexate via an Ommaya reservoir. Unfortunately, the combination of brain radiation and chemotherapy carries a significant risk of leukoencephalopathy. Patients with meningeal carcinomatosis have a poor prognosis, usually with survivals of less than 6 months. In general, best response occurs in lymphomas, breast cancer, and small cell lung cancers. Worse prognosis is seen with other types of lung cancer and melanomas. In this case, the leptomeningeal disease explains the multiple cranial neuropathies, and there is no indication to think about a brain stem infiltrative disease. γ knife targets focal lesions, and is not useful in diffuse meningeal disease.

The typical tumor that crosses the corpus callosum is glioblastoma, and this appearance is called a “butterfly lesion.” Lymphomas have also been reported to cross the corpus callosum; however, this is less common. Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and glioblastomas account for close to 50% of all gliomas. They typically present in adult patients usually above 50 years of age, manifesting with focal neurologic deficits, seizures, headaches, and other features of increased intracranial pressure. Meningioma is an extra-axial tumor that arises from the meninges rather than from within the brain parenchyma, though orbitofrontal and falcine meningiomas can often present with symptoms related to frontal lobe dysfunction. The MRI shown in Figure 8.1 clearly demonstrates an intra-axial tumor, within the brain parenchyma, which is not consistent with meningiomas. Astrocytoma WHO grade II typically shows T2 hyperintensity, but no significant contrast enhancement such as in this case, and 628 does not cross the corpus callosum in “butterfly” pattern.

It has a prominent association with ovarian and breast carcinoma, but can also be seen in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, and other visceral tumors. The patient presents with cerebellar symptoms with a subacute, gradual course over a period of weeks to months. Typically, patients have ataxia that affects the trunk and limbs. They also have nystagmus and prominent dysarthria. Other neurologic manifestations may occur, including diplopia, vertigo, and sensorineural hearing loss. CSF studies may be completely normal, but in some cases it may show slight increase in the white cell count and protein. Brain CT and MRI may be normal at the onset, but there may be evidence of increased signal in the cerebellar white matter and eventually atrophy of the cerebellum. Pathologically, there is loss of Purkinje cells, and there may be degenerative changes of the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei. Anti-Yo antibodies (also known as anti–Purkinje cell antibodies) are seen in the serum of about 50% of patients with this syndrome, especially in those with ovarian cancer, but in smaller percentages of patients with breast carcinoma. Some patients may have anti-Hu antibody (also known as ANNA-1), especially in the setting of small cell carcinoma of the lung. Anti-Tr antibody is associated with lymphomas, and seen more commonly in young men. In many cases, the paraneoplastic syndrome develops in a patient with advanced malignancy; however, in some patients the paraneoplastic neurologic manifestations precede the malignancy and ongoing work-up for malignancy may be required. There is little evidence to guide therapy for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. The progression may subside with removal of the underlying neoplasm, and there have been reports of some improvement with plasmapheresis, intravenous corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin, though the prognosis is generally poor.

Complete removal of the tumor is not possible given that astrocytomas (especially glioblastoma) are infiltrating tumors with no clear margins. However, if the tumor characteristics permit, surgery with near-complete resection or debulking improves neurologic function, reduces mass effect, and prolongs survival. Unfortunately, this may not be possible with very large tumors or with those crossing the corpus callosum. Radiotherapy with focal radiation is an important treatment option, and it is given with a target total dose of 60 Gy for high- grade gliomas, divided into several fractions over 6 to 7 weeks. Adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to prolong survival in meta-analyses in which older nitrosourea agents such as carmustine were used. Temozolomide is an alkylating agent that has replaced nitrosoureas and is currently widely used as an adjuvant therapy. The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma results in significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity to the patient. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that can antagonize the effects of alkylating agents such as temozolomide. Tumors with MGMT methylation have reduced expression of MGMT, with less DNA repair enzyme, and improved survival in patients receiving alkylating agents. For recurrent glioblastomas, treatment includes Bevacizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody that binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF) acting as an anti-angiogenic agent. This medication may decrease edema and reduce the need for steroids. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in 632 Clinical Practice. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012.

      "explicacao": "Age is an important prognostic factor, and in general older patients do worse than younger patients with the same diagnosis. Histologic type and grade are very important prognostic factors in patients with astrocytomas. Regarding the histologic grade, a patient with a grade II astrocytoma has an average survival of 5 to 10 years, grade III has an average survival of 2 to 3 years, and grade IV has an average survival of 15 months or less. The presence of gadolinium enhancement on MRI represents a disruption of the blood–brain barrier and correlates with the WHO grade. Usually grade II and III tumors have no or minimal enhancement, and grade IV tumors characteristically demonstrate ring enhancement, therefore correlating with a poorer prognosis. However, contrast enhancement is not always an absolute parameter, since lower grade tumors may enhance and higher grade tumors may heterogeneously enhance and rarely minimally enhance. The age of the patient is also very important, and elderly patients usually have a worse prognosis than younger patients with the same diagnosis. Performance status is also important in prognostication and when deciding the treatment options, because those with worse baseline pretreatment condition and neurologic impairment will do worse. Pathologic findings with the presence of a necrotic center with perinecrotic pseudopalisading are characteristic of glioblastoma (astrocytoma WHO grade IV), and these tumors have the worst prognosis among the astrocytomas. Certain genetic mutations have been associated with prognosis. IDH1 is a gene that encodes for isocitrate dehydrogenase. 633 Mutations of the IDH1 gene are seen in low-grade gliomas. In a glioblastoma, the presence of IDH1 mutation suggests that it developed from a lower-grade tumor (secondary glioblastoma) and it is not likely to be a primary glioblastoma. IDH1 mutation is associated with improved prognosis. O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that can antagonize the effects of alkylating agents such as temozolomide.

Glioblastoma is a WHO grade IV astrocytoma, which is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and accounts for close to 50% of all gliomas. Grossly, it is a heterogeneous mass with necrosis and hemorrhage. Microscopically, it is very hypercellular, with nuclear atypia and abundant mitoses. Endothelial hyperplasia, necrosis, and perinecrotic pseudopalisading differentiate glioblastoma from other neoplasms, and from astrocytomas of lower grades. Fibrillary astrocytoma is a diffuse astrocytoma, but it does not have necrosis or pseudopalisading. Oligodendrogliomas are hypercellular tumors with uniformly rounded nuclei and clear pericellular haloes, giving it a “fried egg” appearance, which is not seen in this picture. Meningiomas are dural-based tumors originating from meningothelial or arachnoid cap cells, and are histologically composed of monomorphic cells with oval nuclei, sometimes with the presence of psammoma bodies, without necrosis or pseudopalisading.

Ependymomas are the third most common CNS tumor in children, more commonly seen intracranially and especially in the infratentorial region. When supratentorial, these tumors tend to occur in the periventricular region; however, they can also be present more superficially. About 10% of these tumors occur in the spinal cord, more frequently in adults. Macroscopically, these tumors are well demarcated with a 640 tendency to compress rather than infiltrate the parenchyma. Some cases are cystic, especially the supratentorial ones. Microscopically, they are arranged in sheets of spindled cells with round nuclei and small nucleoli. There are perivascular pseudorosettes, in which the cells surround blood vessels (as in Fig. 8.7 ). There are also true ependymal rosettes, in which the cells are arranged around a clear space. Homer-Wright rosettes are not seen in these types of tumors (but rather in medulloblastoma). Most ependymomas are WHO grade II. Anaplastic ependymomas are graded as WHO III, and are characterized by the presence of increased mitotic activity, hypercellularity, and microvascular proliferation. WHO grade II ependymomas may be surgically curable with a good prognosis, being the extent of resection an important prognostic factor. Radiation therapy may be used for residual disease. Prognosis is worse in patients younger than 3 years of age at presentation. Ependymomas in contact with the CSF may produce drop metastases conferring a worse prognosis. Myxopapillary ependymoma is a WHO grade I variant that occurs almost exclusively in the filum terminale. It is more common in adults, has a red appearance grossly, and a thin collagenous capsule. These tumors have a better prognosis. Genetically, ependymomas may be associated with chromosome 22q deletions, and spinal ependymomas may be related to NF2 mutations (not NF1).

The location is intraventricular, more commonly in the lateral ventricles and in the third ventricle near the foramen of Monro. Macroscopically, they are well demarcated, soft, and friable. Microscopically, this neoplasm has round cells in a fibrillary background with prominent capillary vasculature, and sometimes with calcification. This tumor resembles oligodendroglioma; however, neurocytomas are immunoreactive for neuronal differentiation, but not for glial markers, being positive for synaptophysin but negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Ultrastructurally (on electron microscopy), neurocytoma shows neurotubules, neurofilaments, and neurosecretory granules. These tumors are WHO grade II, with good prognosis.

      "explicacao": "The imaging findings in Figure 8.8 are consistent with meningioma, which originates from meningothelial or arachnoid cap cells. These tumors account for 13% to 26% of primary intracranial tumors, and are more common in women, with a peak in the sixth or seventh decades of life. The most common sites include the cerebral convexities, parasagittal region, sphenoid wing, parasellar region, and spinal canal. Clinically, patients may be asymptomatic and the tumor may be found incidentally; however, depending on their location and size, meningiomas may produce focal neurologic manifestations, seizures, or headaches. Meningiomas are dural-based tumors, often with a dural tail seen on imaging and sometimes with mass effect on the adjacent parenchyma. Calcifications may occur. These tumors are generally benign, slow-growing, firm, rubbery, and well-demarcated, compressing brain tissue rather than infiltrating it. However, in malignant meningiomas, there may be tissue infiltration. Microscopically, these tumors are composed of monomorphic cells with oval nuclei, and the presence of psammoma bodies is common. However, meningiomas are very heterogeneous, with multiple histologic variants ranging in the spectrum of histologic WHO grades I, II, and III. The majority of meningiomas are syncytial, fibrous, or transitional types, which are benign variants. Radiologically, on MRI meningiomas are isointense to gray matter on T1 and T2, with homogeneous enhancement. A dural tail may be appreciated as mentioned. In general, most meningiomas are benign and surgically resectable, with the extent of the resection being the major predictor of recurrence. WHO grade III tumors and a high proliferative index predict a higher recurrence rate. Radiotherapy 643 may be used for aggressive tumors. More than half of meningiomas are associated with loss of chromosome 22, and there are associations of meningiomas with neurofibromatosis type 2, previous radiation, and breast carcinoma.

The cells may resemble those of other embryonal tumors, such as medulloblastomas, and there is significant proliferation of small round cells with high nuclear-to- cytoplasmic ratio, and prominent mitotic activity. These cells lack differentiation and resemble primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and not mature pineocytes.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Several types of benign cysts arise in the neuroaxis. These cysts can be resected if symptomatic, and do not undergo malignant degeneration. Colloid cysts arise near the foramen of Monro, and may produce several manifestations including headache and mental status changes. If there is obstruction of the foramen of Monro, patients may present with drop attacks, acute hydrocephalus, and even sudden death. Symptoms may be intermittent, and syncope and other symptoms may be positional, occurring when the patient bends forward or with Valsalva. Radiologically, these cysts may have increased signal on T1, with no significant enhancement, or with a small enhancing rim. Colloid cysts have a thin-walled lining and contain thick and cloudy gelatinous fluid. Microscopically, there is a single layer of columnar ciliated or goblet cells. The treatment is surgical resection, and sometimes shunt placement is required for management of hydrocephalus. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts arise from ectopic ectodermal tissue. Epidermoid cysts occur in young adults and arise from the cerebellopontine angle. On MRI, epidermoid cysts have CSF 646 intensity on T2, being slightly hyperintense to CSF fluid on FLAIR. They have a characteristic restricted diffusion appearance on DWI, which helps to distinguish these cysts from arachnoid cysts. Epidermoid cysts are microscopically lined by squamous-type epithelium filled with keratinaceous material. Dermoid cysts arise in children, and tend to occur in the cerebellar vermis, parasellar, or parapontine region and in the lumbosacral region in the spinal canal. They are a “pearly” white structure, with a content similar to epidermoid cysts, and lined by squamous epithelium; however, dermoid cysts also contain hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. Dermoid cysts can rupture, and the content can incite chemical meningitis characterized by granulomatous inflammation. Arachnoid cysts are basically a cystic space bound by arachnoid membranes, with a location associated with the meninges, predominantly in the temporal lobe region. They are lined by arachnoid cap cells. Rathke’s cleft cysts occur in between the anterior and posterior hypophysis. They have a thin-walled lining containing a cloudy fluid, and are lined by columnar epithelium with ciliated and goblet cells. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

DNET is a benign superficial tumor that is an important cause of refractory seizures in children. These tumors are located in the cortical or juxtacortical region, most commonly in the temporal lobe. The MRI shows a nodular or cystic lesion that is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and does not enhance with contrast. It grows very slowly. Macroscopically, it has a multinodular architecture, with mucinous cysts. Histologically, it is seen as multiple areas in which ganglion cells appear to float within mucin- filled spaces (“floating neurons”).

      "explicacao": "This patient has lymphoma, likely primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) given the parenchymal invasion of lymphocytes with an angiocentric pattern in a patient with advanced HIV. PCNSL occurs predominantly in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with AIDS and posttransplant patients. In these cases they are frequently associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). PCNSL can also occur in immunocompetent hosts; however, this is rare, and there is a lower association with EBV. PCNSL is usually a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma, and rarely caused by T-cell proliferation. In contrast to secondary invasion by lymphomas from other primary sites, PCNSL invades the parenchyma more than the leptomeninges, and histologically, it is characterized by proliferation and diffuse infiltration of atypical lymphocytes with an angiocentric pattern as seen in Figure 8.12 . These neoplasms can be single or multicentric, and can involve the corpus callosum. PCNSL can also involve the eye, and therefore, an ophthalmology evaluation is warranted to examine the vitreous for lymphoma cells. Clinically, the presentation is variable, manifesting with headaches, signs of increased intracranial pressure, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, or alteration in the mental status. MRI shows a lesion with T2 hyperintensity, edema, and contrast enhancement. The prognosis is poor, with 5-year survival rates of 25% to 45%, being much worse in immunocompromised patients. This neoplasm is steroid responsive, and steroids should be avoided before biopsy because they may reduce the yield of this diagnostic test. However in cases of emergency, especially in the presence of significant mass effect and herniation, steroid use may be required. Surgery is not indicated because this neoplasm is often deep and multicentric. The treatment includes radiation therapy and 649 chemotherapy, with agents such as cytosine arabinoside and intrathecal methotrexate. This combination prolongs survival; however, it is associated with leukoencephalopathy and systemic side effects. In patients with HIV-related PCNSL, highly active antiretroviral therapy is the treatment of choice.

Figure 8.13 shows a tumor with multicystic components, characterized by proliferation of cords of epithelial-appearing cells, with a palisade of basaloid cells toward the lumen of the cysts. This is consistent with craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngiomas are benign epithelioid tumors that originate from remnants of Rathke’s pouch and arise in the sellar region, where they grow to produce manifestations from mass effect on adjacent structures, such as the optic chiasm, pituitary, hypothalamus, bony structures, and ventricular system, even to the point of being able to obstruct CSF flow. Common manifestations are therefore visual disturbances, endocrine deficiencies, diabetes insipidus, and findings of increased intracranial pressure. Craniopharyngiomas occur in a bimodal distribution, seen with a peak incidence in childhood and middle- aged adults. Macroscopically, these tumors are partially solid with a cystic component, frequently filled with lipid- and cholesterol- rich brown fluid, also called “machine-oil–like fluid,” which if spilled, may cause a xanthogranulomatous inflammation. Microscopic calcifications, keratin, and xanthogranulomatous inflammation are seen more commonly in the adamantinomatous variant. In the papillary variant, the sheets of cells form pseudopapillae. 650 These tumors are in general surgically resectable. They have a benign behavior, but may recur if there is incomplete resection.

Clinically, they grow slowly and may be asymptomatic, or present with hearing loss, tinnitus, and in some cases with cerebellar findings given that the cerebellar peduncles are compressed. Radiologically, they are seen as circumscribed isointense tumors with contrast enhancement as seen in Figure 8.15 . The location and radiologic appearance of the tumor as shown in Figure 8.15 distinguish it from the other choices. It is extra-axial (not within the brain parenchyma) and is not within the ventricular system. This is not a location typical for metastatic lesions. Given the clinical and radiologic findings, this patient does not have 652 oligodendroglioma, cerebellar hemangioblastoma, ependymoma, or metastatic tumor. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Intracranial metastatic lesion can affect the skull, dura and/or brain parenchyma, or produce meningeal carcinomatosis. The most common source of metastasis to the brain is the lung, followed by breast and then melanoma. Other tumors that may produce brain metastasis include gastrointestinal tumors (especially from the colon and rectum), kidney cancer, and tumors originating from the gallbladder, liver, thyroid, testicle, uterus, ovary, and pancreas. It is very rare to have parenchymal brain metastases originating from the prostate, esophagus, oropharynx, and skin (other than melanoma). Colon and pelvic cancers have a tendency to spread to the posterior fossa. Metastatic lesions can be multiple or single. Multiple metastases are seen with small cell carcinomas and melanomas. Those that are frequently found as single metastasis originate from the kidney, breast, thyroid, or adenocarcinoma of the lung. Hemorrhagic metastases are seen with melanoma, choriocarcinomas, non–small cell carcinomas, thyroid carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas. Patients harboring metastasis typically present with seizure, focal neurologic findings, headaches, and sometimes with increased intracranial pressure. Symptom onset is typically relatively rapid and abrupt rather than gradual. The treatment of brain metastasis includes brain irradiation, surgical intervention for solitary metastasis in some cases, and chemotherapy.

The cells and nuclei tend to be elongated, sometimes with an arrangement in a palisade configuration, which is called Verocay body, as seen in Figure 8.16 . This figure shows an Antoni A pattern. Immunohistochemically, these tumors are S-100 positive. Vestibular schwannomas are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, and the presence of bilateral tumors is diagnostic for this latter condition.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "The imaging findings in Figure 8.17 and appearance of the lesion in Figure 8.18 are consistent with pituitary adenoma. Pituitary 654 adenomas greater than 1 cm in size are classified as macroadenomas, whereas those less than 1 cm in size are classified as microadenomas. Most pituitary adenomas are nonsecretory; of the secretory ones, prolactin-secreting adenomas (so-called prolactinomas) are the most common, though those secreting growth hormone, ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and follicle- stimulating hormone also occur. Luteinizing hormone–secreting adenomas are rare. Patients may be asymptomatic, as in this patient’s case in which the visual field deficit was detected incidentally. In women, symptoms including galactorrhea and amenorrhea lead to earlier diagnosis, particularly in the case of prolactinomas. In men, prolactinomas may present with impotence. Endocrine disturbances may occur with nonsecretory adenomas when the lesion is large enough to compromise normal pituitary tissue function. Other symptoms include headache, ophthalmoparesis, and vision loss. Pressure on or invasion into the cavernous sinus may lead to cranial neuropathies. Pituitary adenomas are the most common masses in the sellar region. The lesion is isointense on T1, and enhances almost homogeneously with contrast, as seen in Figure 8.17 . Figure 8.18 shows evidence of monomorphic eosinophilic cells. Besides tumors of pituitary origin, other tumors that may occur in the sellar region include gliomas, meningiomas, chordomas, metastases, and others. Pituitary apoplexy, or hemorrhage into, most commonly, a pituitary macroadenoma, presents with sudden severe headache, ophthalmoparesis, and in some cases evidence of increased intracranial pressure. The histopathologic findings seen in Figure 8.18 are not consistent with craniopharyngioma or Rathke’s cleft cyst. Craniopharyngiomas are benign epithelioid tumors that originate from remnants of Rathke’s pouch and arise in the sellar region, where they grow to produce manifestations from mass effect on adjacent structures. Craniopharyngiomas are multicystic, with squamous epithelial cells and sometimes calcifications. Rathke’s cleft cysts occur in between the anterior and posterior hypophysis. They have a thin-walled lining containing a cloudy fluid, and they are lined by columnar epithelium with ciliated and goblet cells. 655 Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

Meningiomas are dural-based tumors, which is not the case in Figure 8.19 . Low-grade diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas will not show this degree of edema.

Ki- 67 (or MIB-1) is a marker of nuclear proliferation. In this case, with positive GFAP and very high percentage of Ki- 67, the most likely diagnosis is astrocytoma. Given that GFAP can be positive in gliosis, Ki-67 helps distinguish between the two. A carcinoma will likely be cytokeratin positive. Melanoma will likely show Melan-A and HMB-45 positivity.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Astrocytomas are neoplasms that originate from the neuroglia. These may arise from different regions of the CNS, including the brain, cerebellum, hypothalamus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, brain stem, and spinal cord. The location is influenced by age, and in adults, they are most frequently encountered in the cerebral hemispheres. The clinical presentation may be variable, with headaches, focal neurologic manifestations, and frequently seizures. The WHO grades these tumors using the extent of atypia, mitoses, endothelial hyperplasia, and necrosis as criteria. Astrocytomas are classified as at least WHO grade II in the presence of atypia. Anaplastic astrocytomas are classified as WHO grade III on the basis of the presence of atypia and mitotic activity. Glioblastomas are WHO grade IV, having endothelial hyperplasia and necrosis. Pilocytic astrocytoma is a WHO grade I well- circumscribed tumor, frequently located in the cerebellum, but can also be seen in the hypothalamus, third ventricle, optic nerve, spinal cord, and dorsal brain stem. Astrocytomas can also be classified as diffuse astrocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Diffuse astrocytomas can be subdivided according to the predominant histologic cell type (see questions 2 and 3). Genetic mutations can sometimes help in diagnostic and classification purposes. IDH1 is a gene that encodes for isocitrate dehydrogenase. Mutations of the IDH1 gene are seen in low-grade gliomas, however, WHO I tumors are negative for this mutation. Therefore, the presence of IDH1 mutation can help differentiate between WHO I and WHO II gliomas which are sometimes difficult to distinguish histopathologically. In a glioblastoma, the presence of IDH1 mutation suggests that it developed from a lower-grade tumor (secondary glioblastoma) and it is not likely to be a primary 657 glioblastoma.

      "explicacao": "Figure 8.20 shows an MRI demonstrating signal hyperintensity in both mesial temporal lobes, as well as a PET scan demonstrating increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the mesial temporal lobes bilaterally. These findings are consistent with limbic encephalitis. Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis may affect various parts of the CNS. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is a subset of this syndrome, in which bilateral temporal lobes and other limbic structures are involved. These patients present with a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by personality changes, depression, agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, and a confusional state. Typically, these patients have amnesia, with prominent short-term anterograde component. Sometimes seizures occur as well. The onset is usually gradual and progressive over weeks to months, but there are cases of more rapid evolution. CSF may show mild pleocytosis and increased protein. The MRI demonstrates a characteristic hyperintensity in bilateral mesial temporal lobes, as shown in Figure 8.20 . Histopathologically, there is inflammation with perivascular lymphocytes and monocytes, microglial proliferation, neuron loss, and foci of necrosis. Work up should be done to investigate for an underlying neoplasm and paraneoplastic or autoimmune antibodies. This syndrome can present in patients with small cell lung cancer associated with anti-Hu (ANNA-1) antibodies. In young males, it may be associated with testicular germ-cell tumors, in which case 658 the most common antibody encountered is anti-Ma. An autoimmune, nonparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (anti-VGKC antibodies) may lead to a similar presentation. Treatment involves addressing the primary neoplasm. Some cases are responsive to steroids or other immunomodulatory therapies such as plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulins. A paraneoplastic encephalitis has been reported in patients with ovarian teratomas associated with antibodies to NMDA receptors. This type of encephalitis manifests with psychiatric symptoms, amnesia, seizures, dyskinesias, autonomic dysfunction, and decreased level of consciousness. In these patients, tumor resection and immunotherapy lead to improvement, and in some cases, to full recovery. Dalmau J, Tuzun E, Wu HY, et al.

      "explicacao": "The prognosis in oligodendrogliomas is better than in astrocytomas. Other factors that influence prognosis include age of the patient (better survival in younger patients), presurgical performance status (worse prognosis with poorer baseline functional and neurologic status), bulk of resection (the greater the extent of resection the better), and genetic alterations. Important genetic alterations are chromosome 1p and 19q codeletions, which occur in 50% to 80% of the cases, and are associated with a better prognosis, enhanced survival, and better response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both. Mutation of p53 is not typically seen in oligodendrogliomas, and its presence suggests the possibility of an astrocytic neoplasm. Deletion of the chromosomal region p16 is more commonly seen in anaplastic astrocytomas and 659 glioblastomas, and is associated with progression. Treatment of oligodendrogliomas involves surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The chemotherapy used includes temozolomide, or PCV (procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine).

      "explicacao": "The principle of autonomy is based on the premise that patients are their own ultimate decision makers. Autonomy contrasts with physician paternalism, which dominated the physician–patient relationship in the past, in which the physician was viewed, and viewed him- or herself, as the authoritative decision maker who would simply tell the patient what was best for him or her. The modern-day physician–patient relationship is built around patient autonomy, creating room for shared decision making, in which the physician presents treatment options to the patient and provides the education necessary for the patient to make a decision with the help and support of the physician. In the case presented, the physician has offered all treatment options to the patient, and the patient has made an informed decision to have only symptomatic treatment. The patient clearly understands the implications of his decision, and although the physician does not agree with it, he or she will still support the patient and care for him. Assessment of the patient’s capacity to make decisions for himself is not indicated in this case as the patient clearly demonstrates understanding of the consequences of his or her decision. Denying the patient further care because of the decision the patient has made is clearly the incorrect answer. Making sure to frequently reassess the patient’s understanding and discussing treatment options at later encounters is important, but use of derogatory remarks to coerce the patient into a specific treatment option is clearly not in line with respecting patient 660 autonomy. Option e is a demonstration of paternalism; while physicians should clearly state their medical opinion on the basis of best evidence as to what they feel the best course of action would be, shared decision making, taking into account the patient’s values and wishes, is the basis of respecting patient autonomy.

There is continuous contraction of antagonist muscles leading to rigid posture, difficulty walking, and falls. Muscles are often described as “rock-hard” on palpation. Patients often have an exaggerated startle response with painful muscle spasms. Treatment of the underlying malignancy and immunomodulatory therapies (intravenous immunoglobulin) have been reported. Benzodiazepines may be helpful for symptomatic treatment. 662 Toothaker TB, Rubin M. Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes: a review. Neurologist. 2009;15:21–33"

This increased risk is more common with dermatomyositis (27% to 40%), but is also seen in polymyositis (15% to 18%).

This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that manifests in early childhood. It affects intermediate filaments of both the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to a sensorimotor neuropathy, corticospinal tract involvement with upper motor neuron signs, and optic atrophy leading to vision loss. The characteristic gait includes walking on the inner edges of the feet. The integument is also involved, and patients often have tightly curled hair. The neuropathy is predominantly axonal, and neuropathologic analysis of nerves from patients with this disorder reveals pathognomonic findings of large focal axonal swelling that contain tightly packed disorganized neurofilaments. This disorder is due to mutations in the GAN gene that encodes for gigaxonin, which is involved in cross linking of intermediate filaments. It is progressive and death typically occurs by adolescence. The clinical history, particularly the hair findings, characteristic gait, evidence of CNS involvement, and neuropathologic findings distinguish GAN from Dejerine–Sottas syndrome, or Charcot– Marie–Tooth (CMT) type 3 (discussed in questions 21 and 22), CMT4 (discussed in question 39), and CMT2A (discussed in questions 21 and 22), which also manifest in childhood and can be quite severe. Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MCL) (discussed in Chapter 14 ) is also a severe neurodegenerative disorder that manifests in early life; clinical manifestations include both central and peripheral nervous system manifestations. MCL is distinguished from GAN on the basis of the neuropathologic and imaging features, as well as biochemical studies, including elevated urine sulfatides in MCL (see Chapter 14 ).

RD is an autosomal dominant peroxisomal disorder that results from a defect in an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism, leading to accumulation of an intermediate in this pathway, phytanic acid. Clinical manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa (with night blindness and visual field constriction), cardiomyopathy, and skin changes. Neurologic manifestations include neuropathy, hearing loss, anosmia, ataxia, and cerebellar signs. The neuropathy is a large- fiber sensorimotor neuropathy. The presence of overriding toes due to a shortened fourth metatarsal may aid in the diagnosis. Treatment includes dietary modification to reduce dietary intake of phytanic acid. Clinical features of the other disorders listed also include retinitis pigmentosa and neuropathy, but elevated phytanic acid levels are diagnostic of Refsum’s disease. In myoneurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE), intestinal pseudoobstruction is a prominent feature; other features include ophthalmoparesis and a demyelinating neuropathy. MNGIE is due to a mutation in the thymidine phosphorylase gene. Abetalipoproteinemia, also known as Bassen–Kornzweig syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in defective triglyceride transport, leading to abnormal very low- density lipoprotein secretion. Fat malabsorption results in deficiencies in vitamins A, E, D, and K. Low levels of serum β- lipoprotein and vitamin E in the serum suggest the diagnosis. Peripheral smear shows acanthocytes. Clinical manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa, neuropathy, and ataxia. Neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa syndrome is a mitochondrial cytopathy that results from a mutation in the adenosine triphosphate 6 gene. Patients may present with a predominantly sensory axonal neuropathy. Other mitochondrial cytopathies including mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like symptoms and disorders due to polymerase γ mutations can also lead to neuropathy. Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS) is a mitochondrial disorder resulting from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. It manifests before the age of 20 with retinitis pigmentosa, progressive 711 ophthalmoplegia, cardiac conduction defects, ataxia, myopathy, and hearing loss; neuropathy is not a prominent feature of KSS.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Significant axon loss lesions produce reductions in action potential amplitudes and tend to have preserved or mildly reduced conduction velocities. The F-wave is obtained after supramaximal stimulation of a motor nerve. NCS are classified into sensory and motor conduction studies. Sensory NCS are obtained by stimulating a sensory nerve while recording the transmitted potential at a different site along the same nerve. Three main measures can be obtained: SNAP amplitude, sensory latency (onset and peak), and conduction velocity. The SNAP amplitude (in microvolts) represents a measure of the number of axons conducting between the stimulation site and the recording site. Sensory latency (in milliseconds) is the time that it takes for the action potential to travel between the stimulation site and the recording site of the nerve. The conduction velocity is measured in meters per second and is obtained dividing the distance between stimulation site and the recording site by the latency: Conduction velocity = Distance/Latency. Motor NCS are obtained by stimulating a motor nerve and recording at the belly of a muscle innervated by that nerve. The CMAP is the resulting response, and depends on the motor axons transmitting the action potential, status of the neuromuscular junction, and muscle fibers. The CMAP amplitudes, motor onset latencies, and conduction velocities are routinely assessed and analyzed. As with sensory NCS, conduction velocity is calculated by dividing distance by time. In this case, however, the distance between two stimulation sites is divided by the difference in onset latencies of those two sites, providing the conduction velocity in 712 the segment of nerve between the two stimulation sites. This method of calculating conduction velocity thereby avoids being confounded by time spent traversing the neuromuscular junction and triggering a muscle action potential (since these are subtracted out). In general, for sensory and motor responses, a decrease in the amplitudes correlates with axon loss lesions. On the other hand, prolonged latencies and slow conduction velocities correlate with demyelination. Low amplitudes can result from demyelinating conduction block when the nerve stimulation is proximal to the block. The F-wave and the H-reflex are late responses. The F-wave is obtained after supramaximal stimulation of a motor nerve while recording from a muscle. The electrical impulse travels antidromically (conduction along the axon opposite to the normal direction of impulses) along the motor axons toward the motor neuron, backfiring and then traveling orthodromically (conduction along the motor axon in the normal direction) down the nerve to be recorded at the muscle. The H-reflex is the electrophysiologic equivalent of the ankle reflex (S1 reflex arc) and is obtained by stimulating the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa while recording at the soleus. The electrical impulse travels orthodromically through a sensory afferent, enters the spinal cord, and synapses with the anterior horn cell, traveling down the motor nerve to be recorded at the muscle.

      "explicacao": "Large polyphasic motor unit potentials (MUPs) are not seen in acute neuropathic lesions, but rather in chronic ones. When performing needle EMG examination, insertional and spontaneous activity as well as voluntary MUP activity should be 713 characterized. Insertional activity is recorded as the needle is inserted into a relaxed muscle. It is increased in denervated muscles and myotonic disorders, and is decreased when the muscle is replaced by fat or connective tissue and during episodes of periodic paralysis. Spontaneous activity is assessed with the muscle at rest, and examples include fibrillation potentials, fasciculation potentials, and myokymia and myotonic potentials. All spontaneous activity is abnormal. MUPs are obtained while the needle is inserted into the muscle during voluntary contraction. Various characteristics are of consideration, including recruitment pattern and MUP morphologic features, such as duration, amplitude, and configuration. Recruitment is a measure of the number of MUPs firing during increased force of voluntary muscle contraction. In axon loss lesions, reduced recruitment is characterized by a less-than- expected number of MUPs firing more rapidly than expected. Early or rapid recruitment occurs in myopathic processes with loss of muscle fibers, in which an excessive number of short-duration and small-amplitude MUPs fire during the muscle contraction. With poor voluntary effort or with CNS disorders causing weakness, recruitment is reduced with normal MUPs firing at slow or moderate rates, sometimes in a variable fashion. In neuropathic disorders with denervation and reinnervation, MUPs disclose increased duration and amplitude, and may be polyphasic. In myopathic disorders, MUPs are of reduced duration and amplitude, and may also be polyphasic. Katirji B. Electromyography in Clinical Practice: A Case Study Approach. 1st ed.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "In a radiculopathy, there are normal SNAPs despite sensory symptoms, because SNAPs are recorded distal to the lesion, in the postganglionic projections from the dorsal root ganglion. Thus 714 radiculopathies are usually diagnosed with the needle EMG component rather than the NCS component of the electrodiagnostic study. The dorsal root ganglion is located just outside the spinal canal within the intervertebral foramen. It has sensory unipolar neurons with preganglionic fibers that extend proximally and enter the spinal cord through the dorsal horns, projecting rostrally in the spinal cord. The postganglionic fibers project distally through the spinal nerves and peripheral nerves, carrying information from a dermatome. On the other hand, the motor fibers originate from the anterior horn cells within the spinal cord, projecting distally through spinal nerves and peripheral nerves, carrying motor innervation to a myotome. A radiculopathy occurs from an intraspinal canal lesion resulting in damage of the preganglionic fibers. The cell body in the dorsal root ganglia and the postganglionic fibers remain unaffected, and therefore, even though sensory symptoms are prominent, the SNAPs are normal. An axon loss radiculopathy will also injure motor fibers in the intraspinal canal region affecting the respective myotome. This leads to denervation, with fibrillation potentials seen 3 weeks after the onset of motor axon loss, decreased recruitment, and 3 to 6 months later, large and polyphasic motor unit potentials (MUPs). The presence of these large and polyphasic MUPs is dependent on reinnervation and collateral innervation, typically occurring in a proximal to distal fashion, with proximal muscles more successfully reinnervated as compared to distal muscles. The H-reflex is the electrophysiologic equivalent of the ankle reflex, which is an S1 reflex, and this test is helpful in the evaluation of S1 radiculopathies. Katirji B.

      "explicacao": "The 2-Hz repetitive nerve stimulation shown in Figure 9.1 demonstrates a more than 10% decremental response of the CMAP amplitude, which is consistent with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, due to an antibody-mediated destruction of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (discussed further in Chapter 10 ). Electrodiagnostic studies are important to diagnose this condition and to help differentiate it from other neuromuscular junction disorders. Sensory NCS are normal in MG, and motor NCS are usually normal as well. Whenever CMAPs are found to be low in amplitude, a presynaptic disorder such as Lambert–Eaton syndrome or botulism should be suspected. An increment in the CMAP amplitudes after exercise or rapid repetitive stimulation is a feature of a presynaptic disorder, and not of MG. Repetitive stimulation is a helpful test in the diagnosis of MG, in which there is a decrement of CMAP amplitudes with slow repetitive nerve stimulation (2 to 3 Hz), with a decrement of greater than 10% being consistent with MG. The decremental responses occur due to a normal reduction in the release of acetylcholine after subsequent stimulation and the reduced availability of receptors from the disease, leading to a loss of end- plate potentials and reduction of the motor action potentials. In presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorders, rapid stimulation with frequencies of 20 to 50 Hz produces an incremental response by overcoming the efflux of calcium (which occurs within 100 to 200 ms); this is not seen in postsynaptic disorders where the limiting factor is at the postsynaptic membrane. Jitter analysis by single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) is performed by recording with a single-fiber needle electrode positioned to detect potentials from two muscle fibers of the same motor unit. The variability of the interpotential interval between these two potentials is the jitter, and it is abnormal in MG due to delayed neuromuscular transmission. Neuromuscular blocking can also be detected, and is measured by the percentage of discharges in which one of the potentials is missing. SFEMG is highly sensitive but not 716 specific for MG, being frequently abnormal in other neuromuscular junction disorders. Moment-to-moment variation of the motor unit potentials (MUPs) may be present in MG, meaning that the MUPs vary in amplitude and configuration with successive discharges, due to blocking at some of the neuromuscular junctions of the muscle fibers composing the MUP. Given the abnormal slow repetitive stimulation, as well as the normal NCS and needle examination of the patient depicted in question 7, the diagnoses of myopathy and neuropathy are unlikely. The time frame of the presentation is not consistent with botulism. Katirji B. Electromyography in Clinical Practice: A Case Study Approach. 1st ed. St. Louis, MO: Mosby; 1998.

      "explicacao": "Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission characterized by a reduced release of acetylcholine, and antibodies to presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. LEMS is frequently detected as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with small cell lung carcinoma (discussed in Chapter 10 ). Electrodiagnostic studies are helpful in diagnosing this condition. Sensory NCS are normal, but CMAP amplitudes are usually low to borderline low at rest because many fibers fail to reach threshold after a stimulus, given inadequate release of acetylcholine vesicles. Brief exercise facilitates the release of acetylcholine and results in an increment in the CMAP amplitudes. Patients with LEMS have a decremental response with slow repetitive stimulation, given that there is a decline in acetylcholine release with each stimulus, leading to loss of end-plate potentials and reduction of the motor action potential. However, these patients have an incremental response with rapid repetitive stimulation, given that the calcium availability in the presynaptic 717 terminal is enhanced with repetitive stimulation, resulting in a larger release of quanta of acetylcholine and larger end-plate potentials. This occurs with rapid stimulation (20 to 50 Hz) because the frequency of stimulation is faster than the time it takes for calcium to leave the presynaptic terminal (100 to 200 ms), leading to higher levels of calcium influx and larger end-plate potentials. The incremental response has to be more than 50% to be considered diagnostic. Needle EMG is usually normal in LEMS, as are nerve conduction studies. Jitter on single-fiber EMG is an indication of a neuromuscular junction abnormality, but it is not specific and cannot distinguish between myasthenia gravis and LEMS. Katirji B.

      "explicacao": "This patient has chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), which is a symmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy presenting with proximal and distal weakness with or without sensory loss and hypo- or areflexia. Autonomic involvement may occur, but it is less common than in Guillain– Barre syndrome (GBS). CIDP usually presents in adult patients between 40 and 60 years of age, and it is progressive and/or relapsing, with a time course of at least 8 weeks necessary for the diagnosis to be made. In CIDP, CSF may demonstrate albuminocytologic dissociation. If the CSF cell count is elevated more than 10/mm3 (normal up to 5 lymphocytes/mm3), an alternative cause should be investigated. The diagnosis is made based on a combination of clinical and electrodiagnostic features as well as laboratory studies to exclude other disorders that may present as CIDP. In CIDP, electrophysiologic studies demonstrate features of a demyelinating polyneuropathy, including prolongation of distal motor latencies, reduction of motor conduction velocities, prolongation of F-wave latencies or absence of F-waves, partial motor conduction block, and abnormal temporal dispersion. The specific details on the electrophysiologic criteria for the diagnosis of CIDP are beyond the scope of this book. Figure 9.2 shows a right median motor NCS with stimulation at the wrist and at the elbow, with findings consistent with a demyelinating neuropathy. In this case, the peak latency is prolonged (normal is <4 ms) and the conduction velocity is reduced (normal >50 m/s), with the presence of CMAP amplitude dispersion. All these features are consistent with demyelination. Although not present in this case, conduction block is common in CIDP. Sensory NCS do not play a major role in the diagnosis of CIDP. Sural nerve biopsy should be considered when the CSF or electrophysiologic studies are not supportive of the diagnosis. In CIDP the biopsy will typically show evidence of demyelination and remyelination with onion-bulb formation, and sometimes evidence 719 of inflammation. Nerve biopsy may be helpful to exclude other conditions. When the clinical symptoms do not progress beyond 4 weeks, GBS is the likely diagnosis. When symptoms relapse after treatment and/or symptom progression extends beyond 4 weeks (but <8 weeks), the diagnosis is controversial. Some authors suggest the term subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy to describe patients in this time frame, with manifestations similar to both acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and CIDP. CIDP is the diagnosis when symptoms progress or relapse beyond 8 weeks. GBS is discussed in questions 15, 16, 24, 55, and 56. Multifocal motor neuropathy is discussed in questions 35–36. This patient does not have a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, and therefore this is not myasthenia gravis or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (discussed in Chapter 10 ).

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Peripheral nerve injury severity can range from focal demyelination to axonal injury and finally nerve transection with discontinuity of the nerve. Electrophysiologic studies can help determine the degree of injury. A focal nerve injury can cause segmental demyelination, which is characterized by the presence of slowing at a specific site, or the presence of a conduction block, which is a decrease in the CMAP amplitude with proximal stimulation as compared to distal stimulation, without significant temporal dispersion. The presence of conduction block therefore suggests segmental demyelination 720 and helps localize the site of injury. A conduction block is reversible, given that the lesion is demyelinating. If the injury is severe, an axon loss lesion may occur, eventually leading to Wallerian degeneration, which is typically completed in 7 to 10 days from the injury. During this time, a pseudoconduction block may be observed due to axon loss. After 10 days, the distal axon degenerates and can no longer conduct. Therefore the pseudoconduction block due to axonal interruption resolves. NCS alone cannot localize a focal axon loss lesion 3 weeks following peripheral nerve injury. Once denervation occurs, spontaneous muscle activity appears on EMG, manifested by fibrillation potentials, which usually appear after the third week from the injury. Katirji B.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common entrapment neuropathy. The carpal tunnel is bounded dorsally and laterally by the carpal bones, and the transverse carpal ligament forms the palmar border. The structures that pass through the carpal tunnel include the median nerve most superficially (on the palmar aspect), flexor pollicis longus tendon, four tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis, and four tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus. Carpal tunnel syndrome may be unilateral or bilateral. Symptoms of carpal tunnel include pain and paresthesias in the lateral (radial) half of the palm and first three digits and lateral half of the fourth digit, that classically awaken the patient at night, with patients shaking their hand to relieve symptoms. Shooting pains may radiate up the forearm or even the upper arm; therefore, presence of forearm or upper arm symptoms should not exclude the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Sensation is spared over 721 the thenar eminence because the palmar sensory branch that innervates the thenar eminence travels outside the carpal tunnel. Physical examination may show provocation of symptoms with repetitive tapping on the median nerve at the wrist (Tinel’s sign) and with hyperflexion of the wrists for a period of time (Phalen’s maneuver). The only motor branch of the median nerve distal to the carpal tunnel is the thenar (or recurrent) motor branch; in advanced carpal tunnel, the thenar muscles are therefore weak and atrophied and show evidence of denervation on EMG. In such cases, there is weakness of thumb abduction and opposition, with weakness in activities requiring fine motor coordination of the first three digits such as buttoning. Figure 9.3 shows prolonged distal median nerve SNAP latency. Motor NCS and EMG are normal indicating mild carpal tunnel. With more advanced demyelination, evidence of conduction block at the wrist may be found, but it requires more distal stimulation near or at the palm for confirmation. With more severe carpal tunnel, with axon loss, prolonged distal motor latencies and reduced amplitudes of the CMAP and SNAP are seen. When severe, there is also evidence of denervation in median nerve–innervated thenar muscles on EMG. Absence of neck pain makes radiculopathy less likely. In addition, the brachioradialis deep tendon reflex is intact. Although a C6 radiculopathy would lead to sensory loss over the lateral thumb, it would also lead to sensory loss over the lateral forearm, in addition to weakness in forearm flexion and supination, which are not evident in this case. A C7 radiculopathy leads to sensory loss over the third digit, but both a C6 and C7 radiculopathy are less likely on the basis of the abnormal median nerve sensory NCS, and absence of weakness or fibrillation potentials in C6- and C7- innervated muscles. In radiculopathy, because the dorsal root ganglion lies distal to the lesion, sensory NCS remain normal, despite sensory complaints the patient may have. A brachial plexopathy would usually not lead to the limited distribution of sensory symptoms without motor symptoms as well. Absence of involvement of more proximal median nerve–innervated muscles supports the lesion being at the level of the wrist rather than the elbow. 722 Preston DC, Schapiro BE.

      "explicacao": "This patient has Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS). This is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and a common cause of ascending paralysis. It affects any age group and any gender in all parts of the world. In about 60% of cases, there is a preceding respiratory or gastrointestinal illness 1 to 3 weeks prior. Campylobacter jejuni is an identifiable etiology of the preceding gastrointestinal illness in some cases and is associated predominantly with the axonal variant. GBS is considered to be caused by an immunologic reaction to the peripheral nerves. It is not clear what triggers the immunologic reaction, but it is thought that an infectious or environmental process may contribute to the process in susceptible individuals. The main mechanism is a T-cell–mediated response against myelin proteins that occurs after encountering a cross-reactive antigen, leading to the release of cytokines and activation of macrophages that will damage peripheral myelin. During the process, there is mononuclear infiltration into the peripheral nerves, T-lymphocyte activation, and antibody binding to Schwann cells and myelin components, with macrophages targeting the myelin components. Axonal variants of GBS exist, and are less responsive to treatment with protracted course and worse prognosis. The typical clinical presentation begins with sensory symptoms, especially paresthesias beginning distally, usually in the toes and feet, ascending through the lower extremities, and later the upper extremities. Some patients complain of burning pain, with cramps or muscle discomfort. Lower extremity weakness begins later, and is usually symmetric and ascending from distal to proximal, evolving over days. There is subsequent involvement of the hands 723 and upper limbs, and weakness of the respiratory and bulbar muscles may occur later. Reduced or absent reflexes are evident on examination. Involvement of the autonomic nervous system and respiratory muscles may occur in patients with GBS, and there may be rapid progression with life-threatening complications, such as arrhythmias, bradycardia, tachycardia, hemodynamic instability, and respiratory failure. A patient who is rapidly worsening should be observed with cardiac monitoring and frequent vital sign assessment, as well as frequent evaluation of respiratory parameters, including negative inspiratory force and vital capacity. A negative inspiratory force of less than −30 cc H 2 O or vital capacity of less than 15 to 20 mL/kg support elective endotracheal intubation. The diagnosis of GBS is based on clinical history and examination, and monitoring respiratory function in a rapidly deteriorating patient with a characteristic history and examination is paramount. Other supporting tests are sometimes helpful to make the diagnosis and exclude other potential causes. Identifying cytoalbuminologic dissociation (i.e., high CSF protein and few WBCs) supports the diagnosis. EMG/NCS may be normal in the acute setting and will not likely affect the acute care of the patient. MRI of the lumbar spine may show gadolinium enhancement of the cauda equina, but this will not affect the treatment. MRI of the brain is not indicated. Treatment of GBS is discussed in question 24.

      "explicacao": "The upper extremity receives innervation from the C5 to T1 nerve roots. In the intervertebral foramina, the motor and sensory roots join to form a spinal nerve, which then branches into ventral and dorsal rami before exiting the foramina. The ventral (anterior) 724 rami of these nerve roots join to form a plexus of nerves known as the brachial plexus ( Fig. 9.5 ). The innervation of the upper extremities is discussed below. – Roots Two nerves that innervate the upper extremity branch off the nerve roots themselves. The dorsal scapular nerve, which innervates the rhomboids and levator scapulae, arises from the C5 nerve root. The long thoracic nerve, which innervates the serratus anterior, arises from the C5 to C7 roots. – Trunks The ventral rami of the C5 to T1 nerve roots join to form the trunks of the brachial plexus. The upper (or superior) trunk, formed from the C5 and C6 nerve roots, gives off two branches: the suprascapular nerve, which innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, and the nerve to subclavius. The point where the C5 and C6 nerve roots meet is called Erb’s point. The middle trunk is formed from the C7 root. There are no branches from the middle trunk. The lower (inferior trunk) is formed from the C8 and T1 roots. There are no branches from the inferior trunk. The trunks then divide into anterior and posterior divisions. – Cords and nerves The cords are named according to their relationship to the axillary artery. 725 Figure 9.5 Brachial plexus anatomy diagram. (Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted with permission of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.) The lateral cord is formed from the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunk, and therefore carries fibers from C5 to C7. The lateral cord gives rise to the lateral pectoral nerve, which innervates the pectoralis major. The lateral cord ends as two nerves, the median nerve (which also receives a contribution from the medial cord), discussed further in question 23, and the musculocutaneous nerve, which contains the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and is further discussed in question 67. The posterior cord is formed from the posterior divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunk, and therefore carries fibers from C5 to T1. Three nerves arise from the posterior cord: (1) the upper subscapular nerve, which contains predominantly C7 and C8 fibers and innervates the subscapularis; (2) the lower subscapular nerve, which contains C5 and C6 fibers and innervates the teres major and the lower part of the subscapularis; and (3) the thoracodorsal nerve, which contains C6, C7, and C8 fibers and innervates the latissimus dorsi. The posterior cord ends as two nerves, the axillary 726 nerve, which is discussed further in question 69, and the radial nerve, which is discussed further in question 43. The medial cord is a continuation of the lower (inferior) trunk. The medial cord gives off three nerves: (1) the medial pectoral nerve, which contains predominantly C8 and T1 fibers and innervates the pectoralis minor; (2) the medial brachial cutaneous nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the medial arm; and (3) the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the medial forearm. The medial cord gives fibers to the median nerve and then continues as the ulnar nerve, which is discussed further in question 37. As discussed and shown in Figure 9.5 , both the dorsal scapular nerve and the long thoracic nerve arise directly from the ventral (anterior) rami of the nerve roots. Russell SM.

The patient in question 19 has FAP2, as evidence by the presence of carpal tunnel, a family history of carpal tunnel, mild predominantly sensory polyneuropathy, and absence of prominent autonomic features. The familial FAPs are a group of autosomal dominant multisystem disorders that result from deposition of amyloid proteins in the peripheral nerves and other organs including the heart and kidneys. The most common FAPs, types 1 and 2, result from various mutations in transthyretin, a plasma protein that is synthesized predominantly in the liver and transports thyroxine and other proteins. FAP1 is characterized by onset of symptoms in the third to fourth decades of life. Both small and large nerve fibers are 727 affected, but loss of pain and temperature sensation is most pronounced, with relative sparing of posterior column modalities. Symptoms include lancinating pains and dysesthesias, and autonomic dysfunction, including sexual dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, urinary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anhidrosis, and pupillary abnormalities. Cardiac and renal involvement may occur from amyloid deposition in these organs. Nerve, rectal, or fat pad biopsy with congo red staining demonstrates amyloid, which exhibits an apple-green birefringence on polarized light; transthyretin molecular gene testing is also available for diagnosis. Liver transplant may be helpful for FAPs resulting from transthyretin mutations. FAP2, as depicted in question 19, manifests later than FAP1, in the fourth and fifth decades, and its main features are carpal tunnel syndrome and a slowly progressive polyneuropathy, with absence of autonomic features. FAP3 and FAP4 are rare and not related to abnormalities in transthyretin. FAP3 is similar to FAP1 in clinical manifestations, but with earlier renal involvement and more gastrointestinal involvement, with a higher incidence of duodenal ulcers. Other features may include hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and sexual dysfunction. It results from abnormalities in the apolipoprotein A1 gene. FAP4 manifests in the third decade of life, with corneal dystrophy being a prominent early feature. In later life, cranial neuropathies and skin changes occur; cranial nerves VII, VIII, and XII are commonly affected. Other features include a peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome without autonomic signs or symptoms. FAP4 results from abnormalities in the amyloid protein gelsolin. The FAPs are distinguished on the basis of family history and laboratory testing from primary systemic amyloidosis (which results from deposition of AL amyloid, and is associated with monoclonal protein), and secondary amyloidosis (which results from deposition of AA amyloid, and occurs in the setting of systemic inflammatory diseases).

The clinical manifestations are discussed further below, but respiratory compromise is not usually seen in the most common forms of CMT (CMT1A); it occurs rarely, in some cases of CMT2C. The CMTs, also known as hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies or peroneal muscular atrophy, are a large, heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies. The CMTs can be divided into demyelinating, axonal, and combined demyelinating and axonal forms. They are genetically heterogeneous. 729 The demyelinating CMTs include CMT1 and CMTX. CMT4, discussed in question 39, involves both demyelination and axon loss. In the demyelinating CMTs, NCS generally show diffuse, uniformly slow conduction velocities without conduction blocks or temporal dispersion, indicating a hereditary as opposed to acquired demyelinating process (discussed in question 12). There may be evidence of axon loss in the demyelinating forms as well, particularly in patients with long-standing disease; this is secondary axon loss, and conduction velocities as well as CMAP and SNAP amplitudes will be reduced. In contrast, with the axonal forms, motor and sensory potential amplitudes will be reduced, but conduction velocities will be normal or minimally reduced (discussed in question 3, 4, and 13). At the time of this publication, there were seven subtypes of CMT1; they are all inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. CMT1A is the most common inherited demyelinating neuropathy. Clinical manifestations typically begin in the first two decades of life and include slowly progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, kyphosis, and mild (often asymptomatic) sensory loss. Other signs include hammertoes, high-arched feet, palpably enlarged nerves due to peripheral nerve hypertrophy (which more commonly occurs in the CMT1 group compared to the other CMTs), and pes cavus. Involvement of the upper extremities typically occurs later in life. There is often a family history of neuropathy, though due to variable expression, some affected family members may only have mild features such as hammertoes and may remain undiagnosed for a large part of their life; sporadic cases without a clear family history also exist. Other forms of CMT may be congenital and severe. In the CMT1 group, many of the genes involved are related to myelin synthesis. CMT1A is due to a duplication in the peripheral myelin protein 22 ( PMP22 ) gene on chromosome 17, whereas CMT1B is due to a mutation in the myelin protein 0 gene. CMT1B is more severe in terms of clinical manifestations as compared to CMT1A. In patients with CMT1, CSF shows elevated protein levels in some cases. Roussy–Levy syndrome is phenotypically similar to CMT1A but is associated with the presence of a static tremor and gait ataxia. It has been associated with mutations in both the PMP22 and myelin protein 0 genes. 730 On nerve biopsy, pathologic features of the demyelinating inherited polyneuropathies include demyelination and an onion- bulb appearance due to Schwann cell proliferation. Onion bulbs are not specific for CMT, and also occur with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (discussed in questions 11, 12, and 38). CMTX is the second most common type of CMT. It is demyelinating and is clinically similar to CMT1, but it is X-linked in inheritance; males therefore tend to be more severely affected compared to females. It is due to a mutation in the connexin 32 gene. CMT2 accounts for approximately one-third of the autosomal dominant inherited neuropathies. The CMT2 subtypes are axonal neuropathies; NCS show normal conduction velocities, and nerve biopsy shows axon loss without evidence of significant demyelination. Compared to CMT1, in CMT2, symptoms and signs typically appear later and foot and spine deformities are less severe. Clinical manifestations do not always help distinguish the different CMTs, but some clinical features occur more frequently in the different subtypes. Optic atrophy occurs more in CMT2A2, foot ulcerations in CMT2B, and vocal cord paralysis, intercostal, and diaphragmatic weakness in CMT2C. In CMT2D, unlike in the other CMTs, the hands are involved more than the feet. Peripheral nerve hypertrophy does not occur. They are all autosomal dominant in inheritance, except for a subtype of CMT2A. The genes implicated in the CMT2 group are involved in axonal transport and membrane trafficking. CMT2A2 is one of the most common of this group and is due to mutations in mitofusin 2. CMT3, also known as Dejerine–Sottas syndrome or hypertrophic neuropathy of infancy, is one of the more severe forms of the demyelinating CMTs. It presents in infancy with proximal weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hypertrophy of the peripheral nerves. Prominent sensory symptoms including pain and dysesthesias occur. Patients typically have extensive disability early in life. Both autosomal recessive and dominant forms exist. CSF protein is usually elevated. Congenital hypomyelination is seen along the spectrum of this disorder. CMT3 is genetically heterogeneous; mutations in several genes including PMP22, 731 protein myelin 0, and other genes implicated in defective demyelination are associated with CMT3. CMT4 is discussed in question 39. Clinical features of some of CMT4 subtypes include vision loss, severe scoliosis, and hearing loss. The CMTs can be misdiagnosed as muscular dystrophy; NCS findings, as well as the presence of hammertoes and high-arched foot, help distinguish between the two.

      "explicacao": "If the upper extremity were to be divided into upper arm (above the elbow), forearm (elbow to wrist), and hand (below the wrist), the median nerve does not innervate any muscles in the upper arm. The median nerve is derived from the lateral and medial cords. The median nerve runs down the midline of the arm and crosses over the brachial artery to lie just medial to it as it passes under the bicipital aponeurosis in the antecubital fossa. In the forearm, the median nerve innervates pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor digitorum superficialis (see Table 9.1 for root innervations and action of the muscles innervated by the median nerve). In the forearm, the median nerve gives off the anterior interosseous nerve that innervates flexor digitorum profundus to the second and third digits, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus. The radial nerve provides innervation to the forearm extensors. Before entering the carpal tunnel, the median nerve gives off the palmar cutaneous sensory nerve, a pure sensory nerve. The median nerve then passes through the carpal tunnel (discussed in question 14) and gives off the thenar motor branch, which innervates abductor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis. The median nerve also innervates the first and second lumbricals. The ulnar nerve provides innervation to many intrinsic hand muscles. 732 The median nerve provides sensory innervations to the lateral (radial) two-thirds of the palm and the distal dorsal aspect of the first to third digits and the distal lateral (radial) half of the fourth digit through the palmar cutaneous nerve and through digital branches. Table 9.1 Upper Extremity Muscles Innervated by the Median Nerve, Their Root Innervation, and Action The median nerve is prone to injury with supracondylar fractures. Median nerve palsy can also occur due to entrapment in ligaments or between muscles (discussed in question 59). Russell SM. Examination of Peripheral Nerve Injuries. New York, NY: 733 Thieme; 2006."

      "explicacao": "The iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genitofemoral nerves do not arise from the lumbosacral trunk, but rather from the lumbar plexus. The tensor fasciae latae is a hip abductor; it abducts the 734 thigh when the hip is flexed, not extended. The lumbosacral plexus consists of the lumbar and sacral plexus, connected via the lumbosacral trunk ( Fig. 9.6 ). Figure 9.6 Lumbar plexus anatomy diagram. (Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted with permission of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.) The lumbar plexus is formed by contributions from T12 to L4 and gives rise to three major and three minor nerves. The three minor nerves are the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genitofemoral. The first two arise from a common trunk originating from L1 with some contributions from T12. The genitofemoral nerve arises from L1 and L2. The three major nerves are the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve originates from L2 and L3 (discussed in question 47). The femoral nerve originates from the posterior divisions of L2, L3, and L4 (see question 29 and Fig. 9.7 ). The obturator nerve originates from the anterior divisions of L2, L3, and L4 and divides into an anterior and a posterior division. The anterior division gives innervation to the adductor brevis, 735 adductor longus, and gracilis muscles. The posterior division gives innervation to the obturator externus and a portion of the adductor magnus, which is also innervated by the sciatic nerve. The lumbosacral trunk is a structure that originates from L4 and L5 and joins the sacral plexus to form the sciatic nerve, which is not only the largest nerve of the lumbosacral plexus, but the largest nerve in the body. Figure 9.7 Femoral nerve anatomy diagram. (Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI. Reprinted with permission of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography. © 2015. All Rights Reserved.) The sacral plexus originates from the L4, L5, S1, S2, S3, and S4 nerve roots, with L4 and L5 provided by the lumbosacral trunk as already described. The anterior divisions of L4 through S3 736 contribute to form the tibial division of the sciatic nerve. The posterior divisions from L4 through S2 contribute to the common peroneal division of the sciatic nerve. The superior gluteal nerve originates from L4, L5, and S1 and innervates the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. These muscles contribute to thigh abduction, with the tensor fasciae latae acting as the main abductor when the hip is flexed, and the gluteus medius and minimus acting as the main abductors when the hip is extended. The inferior gluteal nerve originates from L5, S1, and S2 and innervates the gluteus maximus, which is an extensor of the thigh. The posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh originates from S1, S2, and S3 and gives sensory cutaneous innervation to the lower buttock and posterior thigh. The pudendal nerve originates from S2, S3, and S4 and provides sensory innervation to the perineal region and perianal region through the inferior rectal nerve, perineal nerve, and dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris.

      "explicacao": "This patient has hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). It is an autosomal dominant predominantly demyelinating hereditary neuropathy with incomplete penetrance and is caused by a deletion in the peripheral myelin protein 22 gene ( PMP22 ). Duplications in this same gene are the cause of Charcot–Marie–Tooth type (CMT) 1A. Patients with HNPPs classically present with recurrent episodes of focal mononeuropathies or plexopathies of the upper or lower limbs; the peroneal nerve is most commonly affected, followed by the ulnar nerve. The presentation is typically in young adulthood, and a history of compression or traction on the involved nerve can often be elicited. The weakness is not preceded or accompanied by pain, distinguishing HNPP from hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy 737 (Parsonage–Turner), which can also lead to recurrent upper extremity mononeuropathies. Other phenotypes of HNPP, including one resembling CMT or a chronic sensorimotor demyelinating polyneuropathy resembling chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, also exist. NCS show prolonged distal latencies, focal slowing at sites of compression, and in some cases diffuse reductions in SNAP amplitudes. Nerve biopsy shows a characteristic pattern of focal, sausage-like areas of thickening in the myelin called tomacula, as well as evidence of segmental demyelination and axon loss. Nerve biopsy does not typically show significant inflammation in this disorder. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

      "explicacao": "The sciatic nerve originates from the L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3 roots. This nerve is the largest nerve in the body, and gives off two initial branches: the superior and inferior gluteal nerves. The superior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. The inferior gluteal nerve innervates the gluteus maximus ( Table 9.2 ). The sciatic nerve is composed of two different nerves running together: the tibial nerve medially and the common peroneal nerve laterally. In the thigh, the tibial division innervates the adductor magnus, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and long head of the biceps femoris. The short head of the biceps femoris is supplied by the common peroneal division. The tibial nerve then continues in the posterior aspect of the leg and gives innervation to the gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis posterior. The peroneal nerve continues, and after the popliteal fossa, it passes behind the fibular head and divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The superficial peroneal nerve gives off branches to the peroneus longus and brevis, which permit foot eversion. The deep peroneal nerve supplies the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, and peroneus tertius. A lesion in the deep peroneal nerve produces foot drop with inability to dorsiflex 738 the foot without impairing eversion of the foot. Preservation of foot inversion distinguishes peroneal neuropathy from L5 radiculopathy, in which the tibialis posterior muscle (innervated by the tibial nerve) is involved, impairing foot inversion.

      "explicacao": "The femoral nerve ( Fig. 9.7 ) is a large nerve that originates from the posterior divisions of L2, L3, and L4, traveling through the psoas major muscle which it innervates, then passing through the iliacus muscle which it also innervates. After this course, the femoral nerve passes under the inguinal canal into the femoral triangle, located lateral to the femoral artery. It then divides into several terminal branches. There are three cutaneous branches: (1) the medial femoral cutaneous, (2) the intermediate femoral cutaneous, and (3) the saphenous nerve. These branches carry sensory information from the anteromedial thigh, medial leg, medial malleolus, and arch of the foot. The motor branches provide innervation to the quadriceps (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medialis, and intermedius), sartorius, and pectineus ( Table 9.3 ). The patellar reflex is carried through the femoral nerve. Femoral nerve injury will manifest as weakness in hip flexion 739 and knee extension, loss of the patellar reflex, and sensory findings in the anteromedial thigh and medial leg. The femoral nerve can be injured in the retroperitoneal or intrapelvic space, or at the inguinal ligament. Clinically, the distinction between injury at these sites can be made by detection of weakness on hip flexion, reflecting psoas compromise, and electrophysiologically by the presence of fibrillations in the iliacus muscle. Both these muscles are innervated proximal to the inguinal ligament, and their compromise will suggest an intrapelvic injury rather than an inguinal injury. At the inguinal region, the femoral nerve can be damaged by inguinal masses or hematomas, during hip surgery or perineal surgeries, especially associated with prolonged lithotomy position, such as in this case. It is important to distinguish femoral nerve injury from L2-L3-L4 radiculopathy and lumbar plexopathy. The presence of impairment of other nerves will suggest these possible diagnoses. For example, adductor weakness suggests involvement of the obturator nerve, which can occur in L2-L3-L4 radiculopathy or a lumbar plexopathy. Also, the presence of weakness in the distal lower extremity muscles will imply injury to other nerves, excluding a selective femoral nerve injury. Abnormal SNAPs do not correlate with a radiculopathy from an intraspinal canal lesion, because SNAPs will be normal in these lesions (discussed in questions 3, 4, and 6).

Small cell lung cancer is the most common neoplasm associated with neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes; however, other malignancies can also present this way, including breast, ovarian, kidney, and prostate cancers, thymomas, and 741 lymphomas. Certain antibodies have been found to correlate with characteristic clinical presentations, and it is thought that these antibodies are directed against the nervous system, either peripheral or central. Anti-Hu (also known as ANNA-1) antibody is typically associated with peripheral neuropathy and sensory neuronopathy in the setting of small cell lung cancer, and will most likely be positive in this case, though anti-Hu antibody has been associated with a variety of other neurologic manifestations as well. Anti–voltage-gated calcium channel is present in Lambert– Eaton myasthenic syndrome in association with small cell lung cancer (discussed in Chapter 10 ). Anti-Yo is present in ovarian carcinoma and other malignancies, and manifests with cerebellar degeneration. Anti-Ri is associated with opsoclonus–myoclonus with or without ataxia in the setting of neoplasms of the lung or breast.

It is composed of two nerves: (1) the tibial nerve located medially and (2) the common peroneal nerve located laterally ( Fig. 9.9 ). Both are in the same sheath, but remain separated throughout their course with no intercrossing fibers. The common peroneal nerve is more prone to injuries, because it is smaller, more lateral, and has less supportive tissue. The sciatic nerve exits the pelvis through the sciatic notch, gives off the superior gluteal nerve, and then passes under the piriformis 742 muscle, after which it gives off the inferior gluteal nerve. In the thigh, the tibial division of the sciatic nerve gives innervation to the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, long head of the biceps femoris, and adductor magnus. The peroneal division of the sciatic nerve gives a branch to the short head of the biceps femoris in the thigh. Proximal to the popliteal fossa, the sciatic nerve bifurcates into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. Abnormalities in the short head of the biceps femoris help distinguish a sciatic nerve lesion from a common peroneal lesion at the fibular head, as the short head of the biceps femoris is spared in the latter. The tibial nerve gives off the sural nerve that provides sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the leg and foot. The tibial nerve then continues down the leg, innervating the gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. At the medial ankle, the tibial nerve passes through the tarsal tunnel and gives three terminal branches: (1) the calcaneal, (2) medial plantar, and (3) lateral plantar nerves. The common peroneal nerve runs around the fibular head from posterior to anterior and divides into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The superficial peroneal innervates the peroneus longus and brevis, as well as the skin in the lower two-thirds of the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot. The deep peroneal innervates the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, and peroneus tertius ( Table 9.4 ). The sensory territory of the deep peroneal nerve is the web space between the first and second toes. In this patient, both tibial and peroneal nerve–innervated muscles are affected, including the short head of the biceps femoris, suggesting a sciatic nerve lesion, rather than individual tibial or peroneal nerve involvement. The fact that the sural and superficial peroneal SNAPs are affected excludes the possibility of a radiculopathy. Finally, the conspicuous lack of involvement of gluteal nerve–innervated muscles makes the diagnosis of a lumbosacral plexopathy unlikely. The final diagnosis is thus a sciatic mononeuropathy. 743 Figure 9.8 Sciatic nerve anatomy diagram. (Illustration by David Schumick, BS, CMI.

Natalizumab is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, not CIDP. Prednisone can be used for initial therapy, with doses from 1 746 mg/kg/day up to 100 mg/day. Once improvement occurs, the dose can be slowly tapered to a maintenance dose. A steroid-sparing agent may be required, such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil. IVIG can be used with a dose of 2 g/kg over 2 to 5 days and repeated every 4 to 6 weeks according to the response. Plasmapheresis can be used with two to three treatments per week for a total of five to ten treatments. The benefits, however, are transient, and may last from 3 to 8 weeks, requiring repeated treatments. Plasmapheresis may be effective in patients who have significant weakness and those who relapse on steroids, in which case the dose of steroids should be increased along with the frequency and number of plasmapheresis treatments.

Proximal to the popliteal fossa, the tibial division of the sciatic nerve separates from the peroneal division and gives off the sural nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the leg and foot. The tibial nerve then continues down the leg innervating the gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus. The tibialis anterior is an L5 deep peroneal nerve–innervated muscle. At the medial ankle, the tibial nerve passes under the flexor retinaculum through the tarsal tunnel and gives three terminal 747 branches: (1) calcaneal, (2) medial plantar, and (3) lateral plantar. The calcaneal branch is purely sensory and innervates the heel. The medial plantar branch innervates the abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, and flexor hallucis brevis, as well as the skin of the medial sole. The lateral plantar branch innervates the abductor digiti quinti pedis, flexor digiti quinti pedis, adductor hallucis, and interossei, as well as the skin of the lateral sole. An entrapment neuropathy of the tibial nerve at the level of the tarsal tunnel will not produce weakness on plantarflexion. This entrapment neuropathy may manifest with burning pain in the plantar region, worse with standing and walking, with sensory deficits in the sole and sometimes atrophy in this area.

This condition is a purely motor demyelinating neuropathy that presents with asymmetric weakness from involvement of individual peripheral nerves, hypo- or areflexia in the distribution of affected nerves, and no sensory manifestations. CSF studies show normal protein levels, in contrast to acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies. Anti-GM1 antibodies have been detected in this condition, but the presence of these antibodies is not required to make the diagnosis, and does not predict response to therapy. Electrophysiologic testing demonstrates typical conduction block in various nerve distributions. The presence of conduction block is not, however, required to make the diagnosis if there are other features of demyelination, and response to treatment is not different between patients with or without conduction block. Sensory NCS are normal. 748 Patients with MMN do not have a good response to steroids or plasmapheresis, and some may worsen with these therapies. The use of intravenous immunoglobulin has been shown to be of benefit and is associated with clinical improvement. Other therapies that have been reported to be beneficial are rituximab and cyclophosphamide. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is discussed in questions 11, 12, and 38. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is discussed in questions 15, 16, 24, 55, and 56. Subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is a controversial diagnosis that is not generally accepted, but some authors have used this term to define patients with manifestations similar to AIDP and CIDP, with a time evolution between 4 and 8 weeks.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "The ulnar nerve is a continuation of the medial cord. The medial cord gives a contribution to the median nerve and then gives off two branches: (1) the medial brachial cutaneous nerve and (2) medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, which provide sensory innervation to the medial half of the arm and forearm, respectively. It then continues as the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve predominantly carries C8 and T1 fibers. If the upper extremity were to be divided into upper arm (above the elbow), forearm (elbow to wrist), and hand (below the wrist), the ulnar nerve does not innervate any muscles in the upper arm. At the elbow, it emerges from the triceps and enters the postcondylar groove, a bony canal between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon of the ulna. This is where the ulnar nerve is most susceptible to injury (see questions 41 and 45). The ulnar nerve then travels down the forearm, where it gives branches to flexor carpi ulnaris and then flexor digitorum profundus to the fourth and fifth digits (see Table 9.5 for root innervations and action of the 749 muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve). It gives off two sensory branches: (1) the dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve and (2) palmar ulnar cutaneous nerve. Proximal to the wrist it is joined by the ulnar artery. Table 9.5 Upper Extremity Muscles Innervated by the Ulnar Nerve, Their Root Innervation, and Action The ulnar nerve then enters the hand via Guyon’s canal, which is bounded by the carpal bones dorsally and laterally, the transverse carpal ligament medially, and the palmar carpal ligament ventrally (the ulnar nerve does not pass through the carpal tunnel). The ulnar nerve then bifurcates into a deep motor branch and a superficial sensory branch distal to Guyon’s tunnel. The deep motor branch innervates hypothenar eminence muscles: abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, and opponens digiti minimi. The ulnar nerve provides motor innervation to many of the intrinsic hand muscles, which are largely involved in fine finger movements: the 750 fourth and fifth lumbricals, and the dorsal and palmar interossei. It also innervates two thenar muscles: (1) adductor pollicis and (2) flexor pollicis brevis. The ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to the hypothenar eminence, the palmar and dorsal medial portion of the hand, fifth digit, and half of the fourth digit. Russell SM.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination are consistent with an ulnar neuropathy at or above the elbow. This can occur with trauma, lacerations, or blunt injury. There is significant loss of fine motor 752 coordination due to weakness of the third and fourth lumbricals and the palmar and dorsal interossei. Flexor pollicis brevis is innervated by both the median and ulnar nerve, so even with complete ulnar palsy some thumb abduction can still be achieved by the part of the muscle innervated by the median nerve. When asked to make a fist, the hand assumes the appearance of a claw, with the fourth and fifth digits hyperextended at the metacarpophalangeal joint and partially flexed at the interphalangeal joint. This occurs because the third and fourth lumbricals as well as the interossei and flexor digiti minimi are weak, and there is unopposed action of the radial nerve–innervated muscles (Table 9.6), causing hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Other signs seen with ulnar nerve palsy include (1) Wartenberg’s sign, or fifth digit abduction at rest due to paralysis of the third palmar interossei with unopposed action of extensor digiti minimi and extensor digitorum communis (radial nerve–innervated muscles), and (2) Froment’s sign, whereby during attempted forceful adduction of the thumb, as with an attempt to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and the index finger, thumb flexion occurs. This occurs because the adductor pollicis is weak, and thumb flexion (by the intact flexor pollicis longus) is the compensatory action. In the case described, reduction in CMAP amplitude of more than 50% with stimulation above as compared to below the elbow (see Fig. 9.4 ) further supports the diagnosis. Ulnar nerve compression at the wrist, at Guyon’s canal, may occur in bicycle riders or others who frequently place pressure at the medial wrist area. Claw hand, Wartenberg’s sign, and Froment’s sign can all be seen with ulnar neuropathy at Guyon’s canal. Involvement of flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus (which receive motor branches from the ulnar nerve in the forearm) indicate that the lesion is proximal to the wrist. In addition, with lesions at or distal to the wrist, sensation over the hypothenar eminence is spared because the palmar cutaneous branch arises proximal to Guyon’s canal. With a lesion at the wrist, CMAP amplitudes would be abnormally low with stimulation at the wrist, and a reduction in CMAP amplitude would not occur with more proximal stimulation. 753 In the case presented in question 41, other C8-innervated muscles such as the flexor digitorum profundus to the second digit are of normal strength, and forearm pronation is normal, providing evidence that this is not a C7 or C8 radiculopathy. Intact sensation proximal to the wrist excludes a proximal medial cord lesion; when sensory loss extends 2 cm or more proximal to the wrist, the territory innervated by the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (which branches directly off the medial cord), involvement of the medial cord should be suspected. Another feature distinguishing an ulnar nerve palsy from a medial cord lesion is intact strength of median nerve-innervated C8 and T1 muscles, such as flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and the median nerve–innervated lumbricals (see Table 9.1 ). 754 Table 9.6 Upper Extremity Muscles Innervated by the Radial Nerve, Their Root Innervation, and Action Russell SM.

In the arm, the radial nerve gives branches to long, medial, and lateral heads of the triceps muscle (it is the sole innervation of the triceps) and then travels along the spiral groove (see Table 9.6 for root innervations and action of the muscles innervated by the radial nerve). It then gives off the posterior cutaneous nerve, which runs with the radial nerve in the spiral groove of the humerus. In the spiral groove, the radial nerve gives off the lateral cutaneous nerve to the arm. Distal to the spiral groove, it gives branches to the brachioradialis (a forearm flexor), and extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis. 756 Distal to the elbow, it bifurcates into the posterior interosseous and superficial sensory radial nerves. The posterior interosseous nerve innervates extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum communis, extensor digiti minimi, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis longus and brevis, and extensor indices. The radial nerve provides sensory innervation to the posterior arm through the posterior cutaneous nerve to the arm, to the lateral arm via the lateral cutaneous nerve to the arm, and to the posterior forearm through the posterior cutaneous nerve to the forearm. The superficial sensory radial nerve provides sensory innervation to the dorsolateral half of the hand, the proximal two- thirds of the thumb (including the lateral thumb, over the anatomic snuffbox), and the second and third digits (discussed in question 66).

NCS is performed and demonstrates reduced CMAP amplitude of the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis, as well as reduced SNAP amplitude of the superficial peroneal. EMG shows fibrillations in the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis, extensor digitorum brevis, and peroneus longus. Short head of the biceps femoris is normal.

      "explicacao": "This patient has a common peroneal nerve injury, likely localized to the fibular head. Risk factors for peroneal mononeuropathy at the fibular head include significant weight loss, prolonged bedrest or hospitalization, leg crossing, diabetes, and other compressive mechanisms in this area. The common peroneal nerve is a division of the sciatic nerve, giving off the lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf before turning around the fibular head and passing through the fibular tunnel (see Fig. 9.9 ). This nerve then divides into superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The superficial peroneal nerve innervates the peroneus longus and brevis, as well as the skin in the lower two- thirds of the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot. The deep peroneal innervates the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis, extensor digitorum longus and brevis, and peroneus tertius. The sensory territory of the deep peroneal nerve is the web space between the first and second toes. Foot drop can be seen with common or deep peroneal lesions, as well as with sciatic nerve lesions, L5 radiculopathies, and 757 plexopathies. Localization is dependent on the distribution of motor abnormalities seen throughout the leg, especially of muscles not innervated by the deep peroneal nerve. In this case, the patient has abnormalities in both deep (tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis, and extensor digitorum brevis) and superficial peroneal nerve– innervated muscles (peroneus longus). Clinically, foot dorsiflexion weakness is attributed to the deep peroneal nerve–innervated muscles, whereas foot eversion weakness is attributed to superficial peroneal nerve–innervated muscles. Therefore, presence of weak dorsiflexion and eversion points toward a common peroneal nerve injury (as opposed to isolated superficial or deep peroneal nerve injuries) like in this patient. The fact that the short head of the biceps femoris is spared suggests that the lesion is distal to this level. The lack of tibial nerve involvement with abnormalities restricted to the peroneal nerve only makes sciatic neuropathy, tibial neuropathy, or L5 radiculopathy less likely. Sciatic nerve injury is discussed in question 32. L5 radiculopathy is discussed in question 86. Tibial nerve injury is discussed in question 34. Katirji B.

Patients with polyneuropathy are at risk for developing foot ulcers and ankle arthropathy (discussed also in Chapter 16 ). Foot ulcers are a severe complication caused by a combination of factors, including loss of sensation from neuropathy leading to unnoticed trauma, poor vascular perfusion, and higher risk of infection. Ankle arthropathy, known as “Charcot joint,” is a joint deformity associated with loss of sensation and sensory ataxia resulting from neuropathy. Mononeuropathies can involve peripheral or cranial nerves. A typical cranial nerve affected by diabetes is the third nerve, which can occur acutely, usually sparing the pupillary function (discussed in Chapter 1 ). Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Femoral nerve injury in the intrapelvic region can be caused by pelvic surgery, pelvic masses, or retroperitoneal hematomas. The history suggests a retroperitoneal hematoma, which can compress the femoral nerve in the intrapelvic region. This patient has pain with hip flexion and knee extension weakness, as well as absent patellar reflex. There are also sensory findings in the femoral nerve and saphenous nerve distribution. The presence of fibrillations in the iliacus and psoas muscles suggests an intrapelvic injury rather than an inguinal injury, given that these muscles are innervated by the femoral nerve in the intrapelvic region and prior to its course through the inguinal region. The anatomy of the femoral nerve is discussed in question 29 and shown in Figure 9.7 . Involvement of the psoas distinguishes intrapelvic injury from injury at the inguinal ligament (discussed also in question 29). The fact that thigh adductors and other muscle groups are spared suggests that this is not a plexopathy or radiculopathy as only the femoral nerve–innervated muscles are involved.

The posterior interosseous nerve is a pure motor nerve. With a posterior interosseous nerve palsy, there is not an obvious wrist drop because radial nerve branches to extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis originate proximal to the posterior interosseous nerve; there is however weakness of wrist extension in an ulnar direction (see Table 9.6 for muscles innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve). Strength of more proximal radial nerve–innervated muscles excludes a radial neuropathy at the spiral groove or elbow, and intact superficial sensory radial nerve responses on NCS further 761 support this. Intact triceps reflex and normal strength of forearm extension exclude a C7 radiculopathy. Supinator syndrome causes a painful posterior interosseous nerve palsy due to compression or irritation of this nerve as it passes through the supinator muscle.

L2- L3 radiculopathy manifests with pain in the hip and groin radiating down the anterior and medial thigh. If there is an L4 radiculopathy, the pain may also radiate down to the medial leg. L2-L3-L4 radiculopathy may affect hip flexion and knee extension, as well as ankle dorsiflexion due to involvement of the L4 root, which partially innervates the tibialis anterior along with L5. The patellar reflex is reduced or absent in L2-L3-L4 root lesions. The iliacus muscle is innervated by L2-L3 roots. The quadriceps femoris is innervated by L3-L4 roots, and the tibialis anterior is innervated by L4-L5 roots. L2-L3-L4 radiculopathies should be distinguished from a lumbar plexopathy and femoral neuropathy. The differences can be difficult to detect clinically, but may be further clarified with EMG. In radiculopathies, the SNAPs are normal, whereas in plexopathies, they are abnormal. Paraspinal fibrillations are seen in radiculopathies, but not in plexopathies.

This can occur following surgery, vaccination, or systemic viral illness; in some cases, it can be idiopathic. Symptoms of acute brachial neuritis include acute onset of severe shoulder and arm pain, which then resolve, with subsequent occurrence of weakness. This disorder can potentially affect any portion of the brachial plexus and frequently affects multiple nerves originating from the brachial plexus in a multifocal fashion. It can, however, be isolated to a single upper extremity nerve. Nerves frequently affected include the suprascapular nerve, long thoracic nerve, and median nerve. It can also occur in the lumbosacral plexus. This disorder is most often monophasic with good recovery, but recurrent episodes may occur. There is a familial form, hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy, which is autosomal dominant in inheritance. Recovery typically occurs after each attack, though with time residual deficits may be incurred. Some cases of hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy have been linked to SEPT9 gene on chromosome 17. The fact that this patient had normal strength postoperatively argues against a nerve injury related to nerve traction, median sternotomy, or other procedure-related etiologies. Delayed weakness postoperatively should also place brachial plexus compression from a hematoma on the differential diagnosis. Infectious polyradiculitis would be unusual in this postoperative setting, and more often occurs in immunocompromised patients, such as cytomegalovirus polyradiculitis in HIV patients. The cervical-brachial-pharyngeal variant of Guillain–Barre is associated with neck and pharyngeal weakness as well, and the occurrence of pain which then resolves and is followed by weakness is more typical of acute brachial plexitis. 763 Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Brachial artery injury often occurs concomitantly, given its proximity to the median nerve in this area. Intact strength of the ulnar nerve–innervated muscles (see Table 9.5 ) is evidence that this is not a medial cord lesion. Ischemic monomelia, as can occur during placement of arteriovenous shunts for dialysis, is painful and causes circumferential sensory loss in multiple nerve distributions, a clinical picture not evident in this case. The sensory fibers of the median nerve are derived mainly from C6 and C7 through the lateral cord. Weakness of C6- and C7-innervated muscles, such as the pronators, is evidence that this is not a medial cord lesion because the medial cord carries predominantly C8 and T1 fibers. With complete median nerve palsy, on attempt to make a fist, the first digit does not flex, the second digit partially flexes, and the fourth and fifth digits flex normally, assuming a hand position similar to that used in religious blessings, termed the Benedictine sign. The patient in question 54 has anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. The anterior interosseous nerve is a pure motor branch of the median nerve and innervates flexor digitorum profundus to the second and third digits, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus ( Table 9.1 ). Weakness of these muscles, in the absence of sensory loss, suggests isolated involvement of the anterior interosseous nerve, as can occur with trauma, fracture, or in neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage–Turner syndrome; see question 52). Patients complain of weakness in grasping objects with their thumb and index finger, and on attempt to make an “okay sign,” the distal phalanges are unable to flex, and instead, the fingertip 764 pulps touch. In both cases, weakness of C8 and T1 median nerve–innervated muscles is evidence that this is not isolated to the C7 nerve root.

The main findings are consistent with demyelination, and typically show prolonged or abnormal distal latencies and slow conduction velocities, with abnormal late responses, which are the F-response and the H- reflex. Although distal latencies may not be affected initially, they are almost always affected at some time in the disease process. A reduction in the amplitude of muscle action potentials (as opposed to increased CMAPs) is seen. There may also be evidence of motor conduction block. Neurophysiologic data can help to evaluate GBS and determine the presence of other variants.

It is uncommon, but occurs in people who perform repetitive forceful pronation and may be associated with medial epicondylitis, or “golfer’s elbow.” Symptoms include gradual onset of a deep ache in the forearm that may worsen with pronation and weakness in median nerve–innervated muscles. Because branches from the median nerve that innervate the pronator teres arise proximal to this muscle (before the nerve passes under this muscle), pronator teres strength is intact in this syndrome. Apparently normal strength in pronator teres excludes a complete median nerve palsy at the elbow. Weakness of muscles not innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve (such as finger flexors and thumb abductors) indicates that this is not isolated anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. Weakness of flexor carpi radialis, which is predominantly C6 and C7 in innervation (see Table 9.1 ), indicates that this is not a medial cord lesion. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome often have a history of repetitive motions at the wrist, as occurs in certain occupations. Some conditions predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis, acromegaly, pregnancy, obesity, and hypothyroidism. Testing for these conditions in the appropriate clinical setting may be indicated, especially in the absence of evident occupational risk factors or when the presentation is bilateral. Local compression by masses, such as ganglion cysts or neurofibromas, can cause median nerve compression as well. For mild carpal tunnel syndrome, in which sensory symptoms are intermittent and there is no evidence of axon loss on EMG, management includes wrist splinting, particularly at night, and minimization of provocative maneuvers. Surgical therapy is not indicated for asymptomatic cases, though measures to minimize further median nerve compression at the wrist are indicated. In more severe cases, surgery is indicated when there is significant sensory loss, motor weakness, and/or evidence of significant axon loss. Surgery may be indicated for milder cases if symptoms are significant and refractory to splinting and/or if the patient cannot avoid the provocative actions (due to, e.g., employment).

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "The patient in question 61 has a history and examination consistent with a radial neuropathy at the axilla. Loss of sensation over the posterior arm (due to involvement of the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm, the most proximal branch of the radial nerve), as well as weakness of the triceps (which receives innervation from the 768 radial nerve proximal to the spiral groove), indicates that the lesion is proximal to the spiral groove. Proximal radial nerve lesions are not common, but can occur with repetitive pressure to the axilla, as occurs with prolonged crutch use, or with prolonged pressure otherwise on the axilla, as occurs in “Saturday night palsy,” when a person sleeps with his or her arm hung over the back of a chair. Although the triceps reflex (C7) is absent, intact forearm pronation suggests that pronator teres, which is predominantly innervated by the C7 nerve root, is normal, excluding a C7 radiculopathy. Intact arm abduction, mediated in large part by axillary nerve–innervated muscles, excludes a posterior cord lesion. With posterior cord lesions, muscles innervated by both the axillary and radial nerves are weak. The patient in question 62 has a history and examination consistent with a radial neuropathy at the spiral groove. Intact strength of the triceps and intact sensation on the posterior aspect of the arm support that the lesion is distal to origin of the posterior cutaneous nerve to the arm and branches to triceps, excluding a proximal radial nerve lesion or a posterior cord lesion; intact triceps strength and normal triceps deep tendon reflex are evidence that this is not a C7 radiculopathy. Reduced sensation over the lateral aspect of the arm suggests that the lesion is more proximal than the elbow, as the lateral cutaneous nerve to the arm arises from the radial nerve within the spiral groove. The spiral groove is the most common location for radial nerve injury, and a common mechanism is humeral fracture. Other choices are excluded on the basis of the discussion above. Russell SM.

The spinal accessory nerve carries fibers from the lower medulla as well as C1 to C4. It exits the skull base 769 through the jugular foramen and innervates the sternocleidomastoid, which turns the head contralaterally, as well as the trapezius. The trapezius is involved in shoulder shrug along with assisting in elevation of the scapula and assisting the deltoid in arm abduction beyond 90 degrees. Jugular foramen syndrome, or Vernet’s syndrome, results from compressive lesions of the foramen magnum, such as metastases or schwannomas, and there would be evidence of involvement of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves in addition to the spinal accessory nerve (see Chapter 1 ). The cervical plexus consists of the ventral rami of C1 to C4. The cervical plexus provides innervation to several neck muscles including the levator scapula (C3 and C4), which significantly contributes to shoulder shrug (along with trapezius), allowing relatively preserved shoulder shrug strength in the setting of trapezial weakness. The cervical plexus is also the origin of the nerves that supply sensory innervation to the posterior head and neck regions, including the lesser occipital nerves that provide sensation to the area posterior to the ear, the greater occipital nerves, which carry predominantly C2 fibers and provide sensory innervation to most of the posterior head, the greater auricular nerves, and the transverse cervical nerves.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination are consistent with a musculocutaneous neuropathy. Such neuropathies in isolation are rare, but can occur with anterior shoulder dislocations and other types of trauma. The musculocutaneous nerve is a continuation of the lateral cord and carries predominantly C5 and C6 fibers. The musculocutaneous nerve innervates the coracobrachialis muscle that assists the deltoid in anterior flexion of the arm at the shoulder and stabilizes the humerus during forearm flexion. The musculocutaneous nerve then innervates the brachialis muscle and the biceps brachii, which flex the forearm at the elbow. The brachioradialis, innervated by the radial nerve, also contributes to forearm flexion. The biceps brachii also supinates the forearm, and is the main forearm supinator when the forearm is flexed. The musculocutaneous nerve provides sensory innervation to the lateral half of the forearm via the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, but this nerve does not provide any sensation below the wrist. The latter point, along with intact strength of the brachioradialis in the case (as evidence by stronger forearm supination with the forearm extended), is evidence that this is not a C6 radiculopathy. Absence of palpable contraction of the biceps during attempted forearm flexion is evidence that this is not biceps tendon rupture. A lateral cord lesion would lead to weakness in other C5- to C7-innervated muscles, such as flexor carpi radialis and pronator teres (see Tables 9.1 and 9.6 ). It would also lead to sensory loss over the palm, palmar aspect of the thumb, and second 772 and third digits. Therefore, absence of weakness in wrist flexion and forearm pronation distinguishes a lateral cord lesion from musculocutaneous palsy. A median neuropathy would lead to weakness in muscles innervated by the median nerve (see Table 9.1 ), not evident in this case. Russell SM. Examination of Peripheral Nerve Injuries.

Patients with small-fiber neuropathy present with painful burning sensations and dysesthesias distally (most frequently in the feet). Some patients may have autonomic manifestations that compromise sweating, vasomotor control, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary functions. In pure small-fiber neuropathy, besides sensory findings, the neurologic examination is normal, including motor and reflex examination, distinguishing it from large-fiber neuropathy. Symptoms may also include hyperesthesia (increased sensitivity to painful stimuli) and allodynia (pain resulting from stimuli that would not be expected to be painful). A cause is not found in the majority of cases. There are multiple causes of small-fiber neuropathy that account for a small percentage of the cases and should be investigated. Of the cases in which an etiology is found, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are the most common. Other less common causes include hypothyroidism, chronic alcohol toxicity, amyloidosis, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, HIV, hyperlipidemia, Sjogren’s syndrome, and connective tissue disorders. EMG/NCS are normal because these tests evaluate the integrity of large nerve fibers. Tests that help in making the diagnosis include quantitative sudomotor axon-reflex test (QSART), thermoregulatory sweat test (TST), and skin biopsy. QSART evaluates postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic sudomotor function, and is performed by stimulation of sweat glands by iontophoresis of acetylcholine. TST assesses the pattern of sweating 773 and dysfunction of sweating by placing the patient in a warming chamber while covered by a reactive powder that changes color with sweat. In small-fiber neuropathy with distal involvement, abnormal sweating is typically detected in hands and feet but not in the trunk. Skin biopsy determines intraepidermal nerve fiber density, which is significantly reduced in segments involved in small-fiber neuropathy. The treatment should target the underlying cause when determined. Symptomatic treatment includes medications for neuropathic pain, including gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, and amitriptyline, among others. Al-Shekhlee A, Chelimsky TC, Preston DC.

Axillary neuropathies occur with fractures at the surgical neck of the humerus and with anterior shoulder dislocations. The axillary nerve is a continuation of the posterior cord, and carries predominantly C5 and C6 fibers. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid muscle, which is the main arm abductor, particularly between 30 and 90 degrees (supraspinatus significantly contributes to arm abduction in the first 30 degrees of abduction and the trapezius contributes to greater than 90 degrees). The deltoid has three heads: (1) the anterior head, which is involved arm flexion (in front of the body), assisted by serratus anterior, (2) the lateral head, which along with the anterior head is mainly involved in arm abduction to the side and slightly anteriorly, and (3) the posterior head, which is involved in posterior movement of the abducted arm. The axillary nerve also innervates teres minor, which externally rotates the arm along with infraspinatus. The axillary nerve provides sensory innervation to the upper lateral arm through the upper lateral brachial 774 cutaneous nerve. Intact arm abduction in the first 30 degrees suggests the supraspinatus is of normal strength. In addition, there is intact sensation over the posterolateral arm, territory innervated by the C5 nerve root through the lateral and posterior cutaneous nerves to the arm (radial nerve branches). These findings make a C5 radiculopathy unlikely. Intact strength of radial nerve–innervated muscles excludes a posterior cord lesion and a radial neuropathy; intact strength of predominantly C7-innervated muscles (see Table 9.1 and Table 9.6 ) excludes a middle trunk lesion.

Females can be affected, but the phenotype is milder than in males, with renal failure being less common. It is a lysosomal storage disease that results from accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various organs. Commonly involved organs include the kidneys, heart, and skin. Typical skin findings include angiokeratomas, dark punctuate lesions that are often found on the trunk, and intertriginous areas such as the axilla and scrotum. Both central and peripheral nervous system complications can occur. Peripheral nervous system complications include small-fiber neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. Strokes in Fabry’s disease can be cardioembolic or due to large or small vessel occlusion. Endothelial deposition of globotriaosylceramide can lead to dolichoectasia, increasing risk for thrombosis. Enzyme replacement therapy for this disorder is available. Deficiency of arylsulfatase A leads to metachromatic leukodystrophy (discussed in Chapter 14 ). Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

With chronic denervation of the rhomboids, intrascapular wasting can occur. It is important to note that C5 has a significant contribution to the phrenic nerve, which also receives contributions from C3 and C4.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "The history and examination are consistent with suprascapular nerve entrapment, as can occur in athletes, but also due to trauma (shoulder dislocation or scapular fracture). The clinical picture is one of poorly localizable shoulder pain, and weakness of the supraspinatus, which abducts the arm, particularly during the first 30 degrees of abduction, and infraspinatus, which externally rotates the shoulder when the elbow is flexed and fixed at the patient’s side. The distribution of weakness in this patient is not consistent with long thoracic nerve injury. The long thoracic nerve arises from the C5, C6, and C7 roots and innervates serratus anterior, which acts to abduct the scapula. Injury to it causes winging of the scapula, which is most evident when the arms are extended and pressure is applied anteriorly (as if doing a push-up on a wall). Scapular 776 winging also occurs with rhomboid weakness. Normal strength of forearm flexion suggests the biceps, a largely C5-innervated muscle, is normal; an intact biceps deep tendon reflex is further evidence that this is not a C5 radiculopathy. For similar reasons, an upper trunk lesion is also excluded. The history is also not consistent with thoracodorsal nerve injury because arm adduction is normal in this patient; the thoracodorsal nerve arises from the posterior cord and innervates the latissimus dorsi, which acts to adduct the arm. The other two branches of the posterior cord are also involved in arm abduction (as well as internal rotation): (1) the upper subscapular nerve, which innervates the subscapularis muscle, and (2) the lower subscapular nerve, which innervates teres major as well as a portion of the subscapularis muscle.

The signs and symptoms result from compression on the C8 and T1 nerve roots. The brachial plexus passes through the scalene triangle, which is formed by the anterior scalene, middle scalene, and first rib. An anomalous fibrous band between the scalene muscles, a cervical rib, or an elongated C7 transverse process can lead to neural compression or irritation, resulting in neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. There is weakness of intrinsic hand muscles and sensory loss in a C8 and T1 distribution; the pattern of weakness distinguishes this disorder from the other disorders listed, which would lead to weakness in muscle groups innervated by the single nerves listed. Arm abduction and external rotation can precipitate symptoms and reduce the radial pulse. Sensory loss in both C8 and T1 dermatomes distinguishes thoracic outlet syndrome from isolated radiculopathy (the most medial aspect of the ventral forearm is innervated by C8, whereas the T1 nerve root innervates an area of the forearm lateral to that).

      "explicacao": "The history and examination of the patient in question 75 suggest the diagnosis of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) type 1. In question 76, the diagnosis is HSAN3. The patient in question 77 suffers from HSAN4. The HSANs are a relatively rare, genetically and phenotypically 778 heterogeneous group of hereditary neuropathies. As a group, they share in common prominent sensory signs and symptoms, including pain, sensory loss, and autonomic features with little motor involvement. Because of the sensory loss, patients with HSANs are prone to painful calluses, stress fractures, neuropathic (Charcot) joints, skin ulcerations that heal poorly, and infections with deep tissue involvement, such as osteomyelitis, leading to disfiguring acral mutilations. Question 75 depicts HSAN1. HSAN1 is the most common HSAN. It is autosomal dominant. Presentation is typically in young adulthood. Painful sensory symptoms such as lancinating pains are prominent. There is relatively dissociated sensory loss, with pain and temperature affected more than dorsal column modalities. The main autonomic manifestation is hypohidrosis. Only in advanced cases do muscle weakness and atrophy occur. Hearing loss can rarely occur. HSAN1 results from a mutation in the gene encoding for serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of sphingolipid synthesis. HSAN2 begins in infancy, and is characterized by generalized loss of sensation and insensitivity to pain, leading to significant risk of mutilation to the hands, feet, lips, and tongue. Autonomic symptoms are not prominent and cognitive function is normal. Associated features include areflexia and retinitis pigmentosa. NCS show evidence of axon loss, with absence of SNAPs. Question 76 depicts HSAN3, also known as familial dysautonomia or Riley–Day syndrome, an autosomal recessive HSAN with prominent autonomic features. Symptom onset is in infancy with dysphagia, vomiting, recurrent infections, and blood pressure lability. It is particularly prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews. With emotional stimulation, there is hyperhidrosis, skin flushing, and hypertension. Other autonomic features include absence of lacrimation. The tongue may be smooth due to absence of fungiform papillae. Later in life, evidence of a predominantly sensory neuropathy with insensitivity to pain occurs, as well as areflexia. Nerve biopsy shows a marked reduction in the density of unmyelinated axons and small myelinated axons, with a reduction in autonomic ganglia cell bodies. HSAN3 is due to a mutation in the IKAP gene, which results in abnormal mRNA splicing, leading 779 to dysregulation of neural endocytosis. Question 77 depicts HSAN4, or congenital insensitivity to pain. This is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by insensitivity to pain, leading to repeated injury and self-mutilation. Cognitive delay is also present, as are significant behavioral problems including hyperactivity. Autonomic features include anhidrosis, leading to heat intolerance and frequent fevers. There is little evidence of large-fiber sensory or motor neuropathy on examination or EMG/NCS; diagnosis is made by demonstration of absent or a markedly reduced number of unmyelinated axons and small myelinated fibers on skin biopsy, absence of nerve endings in sweat glands, as well as absence of sweating by quantitative sudomotor axon-reflex test. This disorder results from mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor for nerve growth factor NTRK1, which plays a role in the development of unmyelinated nociceptive and sudomotor fibers. Prominence of sensory features with relatively few motor manifestations and the presence of autonomic signs and symptoms distinguish the HSANs from Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT). CMT1A does not typically include features of early prominent dysphagia or autonomic dysfunction, but other features are present, as discussed in questions 21 and 22.

These episodes may be precipitated by exposure to either heat or cold. Patients are typically asymptomatic between episodes. This disorder is due to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN9A gene, which results in hyperactivity of the dorsal root ganglia. In the patient presented in question 80, the family history and normal routine laboratory testing make primary erythromelalgia the more likely diagnosis. However, there are secondary causes of erythromelalgia that warrant consideration in the appropriate clinical context. Secondary erythromelalgia can be seen with polycythemia rubra vera and other myeloproliferative disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune disorders. Some secondary causes of erythromelalgia respond to aspirin therapy. Note that Fabry’s disease is on the differential diagnosis of erythromelalgia as Fabry’s can lead to painful acroparesthesias that are worsened with heat exposure and exercise, but evidence of small-fiber neuropathy on examination and other findings on history and examination distinguish between these two disorders (discussed in question 70). There is no evidence of small-fiber neuropathy due to glucose intolerance, and the episodic nature of the symptoms further excludes that diagnosis. The episodic nature of the symptoms with normal examination otherwise is evidence that this is not hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

It may be associated with other neoplasms, such as neuroendocrine tumors, lymphomas, breast and ovarian cancers, and sarcomas. Another condition that typically can cause sensory neuronopathy is Sjogren’s syndrome, which is a condition characterized by inflammation of the exocrine glands leading to keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia (discussed in Chapter 16 ).

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with an acute hepatic porphyria. The acute hepatic porphyrias are autosomal dominant and involve multiple areas of the neuraxis. They result from enzymatic dysfunction in porphyrin metabolism with subsequent abnormalities in heme synthesis and metabolism. These disorders include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), which results from various mutations that lead to reduced activity of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase; variegate porphyria, which results from reduced activity of the enzyme protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase; hereditary coproporphyria, which results from reduced activity in the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase; and plumboporphyria, which results from reduced enzymatic activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase. Because the dysfunctional enzymes have some residual enzyme activity, symptoms often do not appear until adolescence or later, with some symptoms occurring in episodes with exposure to certain triggers. Common triggers include medications, menstruation, and alcohol exposure. With exposure to these triggers, activity of the hepatic enzyme ALA synthase increases, leading to overproduction of heme precursors that cannot be sufficiently metabolized by the involved downstream enzymes. The different porphyrias differ in several biochemical aspects, but the neurologic manifestations of all four disorders are similar. 784 Symptoms typically manifest in early adulthood, with females being more commonly and more severely affected as compared to males. Symptoms typically begin with abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by neurologic symptoms, including most prominently manifestations of autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile hypertension, orthostasis, and urinary retention). Neuropsychiatric symptoms including psychosis occur, and seizures may be present as well. In some patients, a subacute predominantly motor neuropathy occurs; the arms may be affected prior to the legs, and proximal muscles are involved more than distal muscles. Involvement of the radial nerve in isolation may occur. The neuropathy is both axonal and demyelinating. Cranial nerve involvement, and even respiratory muscle involvement leading to respiratory failure, may occur. In AIP, photosensitivity is not present, whereas with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, photosensitivity with skin blistering and hyperpigmentation occur. During an attack, elevated levels of porphobilinogen and aminolevulinic acid are detectable in the urine and serum. Elevated protoporphyrinogen and coproporphyrinogen in the stool distinguish variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria from AIP. Management of the porphyrias involves prevention of attacks by avoidance of drugs that may precipitate the attack (including antiepileptics, particularly barbiturates) and other triggers. Treatment of attacks includes supportive care, a high-carbohydrate diet, and in some cases hematin, which suppresses δ-ALA synthase activity. Although Wilson’s disease is on the differential diagnosis of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, it does not typically lead to peripheral motor mononeuropathies or abdominal pain, except in the setting of hepatic impairment, and there is no evidence of liver disease in the case presented (see Chapter 6 for more on Wilson’s disease). The history presented is not consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (discussed in Chapter 7 ), in which the MRI would be abnormal, or acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (discussed in questions 15, 16, 24, 55, and 56). Although systemic lupus erythematosus can lead to a 785 similar clinical picture, normal MRI of the brain and CSF analysis, and lack of other manifestations of lupus make this diagnosis less likely.

The physician notices the patient’s arm is weak; on further questioning, the patient states, “I have been like this since I was born, my mom said that is just how I was made.” On examination, he holds his right arm close to his body, internally rotated, with his wrist and fingers flexed. Arm abduction and flexion are weak. Arm extension is normal in strength. Biceps deep tendon reflex is absent, but triceps deep tendon reflex is normal. There is sensory loss along the lateral half of the arm and forearm and the thumb and index finger. EMG shows no evidence of denervation in the rhomboids.

This type of injury is called Erb’s palsy and commonly occurs when the shoulder is forcefully pulled down while the neck is flexed in the opposite direction, as can occur with birth injury. Other mechanisms of injury include falls and motorcycle accidents. The posture held by the patient depicted in question 84, “waiter’s tip” position, is a classic example of Erb’s palsy. Arm adduction and internal rotation result from unopposed action of the pectoralis major; the clavicular head of the pectoralis major is innervated by the lateral pectoral nerve that arises from the lateral cord and acts to adduct and internally rotate the arm. Forearm extension results from unopposed action of the triceps and forearm pronation from unopposed action of pronator teres; both of these muscles are predominantly C7 innervated, and normal strength in these muscles as well as a normal triceps deep tendon reflex excludes a C7 root lesion and a middle trunk lesion (because the middle trunk carries only C7 fibers). Normal rhomboids on EMG suggest that the C5 and C6 nerve roots, which are the origin of the dorsal scapular nerves, are normal (discussed in questions 17 and 71). This patient’s deficits, including weakness of wrist flexors, suggest the lesion is more extensive than just an axillary neuropathy. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

There are two types: type 1 caused by a mutation in the calcium channel gene CACNA1S on chromosome 1q31, and type 2 caused by a mutation in the sodium channel gene SCN4A. These patients present with episodes of weakness without myotonia. The weakness can be focal or generalized and ranges from mild to severe, associated with hyporeflexia (during the attacks). Attacks can last for hours, with some persistent mild weakness for a few days. During attacks, the creatine kinase level may be elevated and the serum potassium is usually reduced. These episodes are triggered by exercise, meals rich in carbohydrates, 825 ethanol, cold exposure, and emotional stressors. Provocative testing can be performed with glucose administration. The main management strategy is to avoid triggers; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide and potassium-sparing diuretics are also useful in treating this condition. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, on the other hand, presents with episodes of weakness triggered by resting after exercise and fasting. This condition is autosomal dominant and is caused by a mutation in the sodium channel gene SCN4A. Provocative testing is done with administration of potassium. Treatment is focused on avoiding triggers. During attacks, glucose can be provided, and as prophylactic therapy, thiazide diuretics can be used. Andersen–Tawil syndrome is also a channelopathy characterized by periodic paralysis, ventricular arrhythmias, and dysmorphic features.

This type of myopathy typically presents with hypotonia and weakness at birth, or in early childhood, and unlike other forms of congenital myopathy, there is ptosis and ocular palsies, as well as weakness of facial, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and neck muscles. Proximal and distal weakness and hyporeflexia can be seen. Severe forms may be fatal due to respiratory failure in the first few months of life, but in some cases respiratory involvement is mild and/or delayed. Creatine kinase levels are mildly elevated. Needle EMG shows a myopathic pattern with positive waves and fibrillations. Pathologically, there are small muscle fibers and central nucleation, as well as predominance of type I fibers, which are small and hypotrophic. Myotubular myopathy is the most common form of centronuclear myopathy and is X-linked. It is typically severe and presents in the neonatal period.

In the early-onset group the female to male ratio is 7:3 and in late-onset it is 1:1. Myasthenia gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular junction 827 transmission. It is most commonly autoimmune in etiology, though there are rare cases of congenital myasthenia that are genetic (see question 50). Myasthenia gravis may present with a myriad of symptoms; the hallmarks are fluctuations and fatigability, with weakness worsening with increased muscle use. Ocular muscles are most commonly involved, with ptosis and diplopia as the presenting symptom in 70% to 90% of cases. Up to 80% of such patients generalize to involve bulbar, limb, neck, and/or respiratory muscles within 2 years. In a minority (10% to 15%), involvement remains restricted to the eyes, so-called ocular myasthenia. Other patients present with predominantly bulbar symptoms due to involvement of muscles of mastication, speech, swallowing, and facial expression, leading to weakness and/or fatigability of chewing, dysphagia, and/or dysarthria. Limb and neck weakness may also occur. Myasthenic crisis (discussed in questions 15–16), or respiratory failure due to involvement of respiratory muscles, can be the presenting symptom, but more commonly occurs in those with exacerbation of symptoms in the setting of stressors such as infection or surgery. Myasthenia gravis is more common in family members of patients with this disorder. It has been associated with human leukocyte antigen types B8, DR1, DR2, and DR3. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at an increased risk of other autoimmune disorders including thyroid disorders, and these should be tested for as clinically indicated. Amato AA, Russell JA.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "In over 80% to 85% of patients with myasthenia gravis, the pathophysiology relates to the presence of circulating anti- acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which have an affinity to the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor and can be binding, blocking, or modulating. The most commonly detected are the binding type. These antibodies cause complement-mediated destruction of the 828 junctional folds that contain dense concentrations of this receptor, and a higher rate of internalization and destruction of acetylcholine receptors. Blocking antibodies might block binding of acetylcholine to its receptor at the neuromuscular junction, while modulating bind to a site on the receptor other than the acetylcholine binding site and alter the structure of the active site. Antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels occur in Lambert– Eaton myasthenic syndrome (discussed in questions 43 and 44). Botulinum toxin inhibits exocytosis of presynaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine (discussed in Chapter 17 ). Rarely, myasthenia results from mutations in the acetylcholine receptor gene (discussed in question 50). Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Edrophonium is an intravenous acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the presence of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In patients with myasthenia, administration of edrophonium leads to transient improvement of weakness within minutes of administration; the edrophonium (Tensilon) test has therefore been used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Laboratory testing for serum autoantibodies also aids in the diagnosis; positive tests confirm the diagnosis of autoimmune myasthenia gravis in the appropriate clinical setting, but their absence does not exclude it. Acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies can be detected by measuring binding to purified acetylcholine receptors radiolabeled with α-bungarotoxin. The sensitivity of this test is highest for generalized myasthenia, detecting antibodies in 70% to 95% of patients and lower for patients with ocular myasthenia. Patients who are initially seronegative for binding, blocking, or modulating antibodies may seroconvert later in the course of their disease. In a minority of patients with autoimmune myasthenia in whom the binding antibody is not detectable, modulating or blocking antibodies may be present. False-positive testing for these antibodies is rare, but can occur in patients with other autoimmune disorders. Anti- 829 striational muscle antibodies can be positive in myasthenia patients with thymoma, but they are much less sensitive and specific than acetylcholine receptor antibodies for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The patient’s clinical picture, rather than antibody levels, is used to monitor response to therapy. In approximately half of all patients who are seronegative for antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, anti–muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies are present (discussed in question 27). EMG findings in myasthenia gravis include electrodecremental response and jitter. The presence of a 10% or greater decrement in amplitude of a CMAP between the first and fourth to fifth stimuli with repetitive nerve stimulation suggests an NMJ disorder (see Chapter 9 ). If there is not an abnormality present on repetitive nerve stimulation but there is a high clinical suspicion for myasthenia gravis and it cannot be confirmed with serologic testing, a single-fiber EMG can be performed. Single-fiber EMG is the most sensitive test of NMJ transmission. Jitter is the variability in the measure of interpotential difference between two muscle fiber action potentials during consecutive discharges of the same motor unit. Increased jitter (or increased interpotential time) is present in patients with NMJ abnormalities, but is not specific for myasthenia gravis. Blocking on single-fiber EMG is failure of a single muscle fiber action potential to appear during the motor unit discharge, and occurs when there is significantly increased jitter.

Fukuyama CMD is autosomal recessive, caused by a mutation of the fukutin gene on chromosome 9q. It is characterized by weakness and ocular and CNS abnormalities. Patients are hypotonic and floppy, with joint contractures at the hip, knee, and ankles. The weakness may be generalized, and these patients typically do not learn to walk.

Central nervous system involvement is common, including cognitive developmental delay and seizures. Brain MRI shows abnormalities in gyration and characteristic white matter changes in the frontal regions.

Age of onset is on average 16 in males and 20 in females, but can be variable, ranging between the first and sixth decades of life. These patients have weakness that can be asymmetric, and present with difficulty lifting their arms above their head, with prominent involvement of the upper arms (scapular muscles, biceps, triceps, trapezius, serratus anterior, and pectoralis), with relative sparing of the deltoids. The upper arm seems to be more atrophic than the forearms, making the bones of the shoulder appear prominent. Facial weakness is evident, with weakness of the orbicularis oculi, zygomaticus, and orbicularis oris. There is also weakness of the lower abdominal muscles, producing 832 the “Beevor sign,” in which the umbilicus moves upward with neck flexion. Pelvic muscles are compromised later. Weakness of foot dorsiflexion with preservation of plantar flexion strength is characteristic. The masseters, temporalis muscle, extraocular muscles, and pharyngeal and respiratory muscles are usually spared. Cardiac involvement is rare and intelligence is typically normal. Creatine kinase levels are normal to slightly elevated. The other options are unlikely in this case. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is discussed in questions 19 and 20. Becker’s muscular dystrophy is discussed in questions 30 and 31. Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is discussed in questions 51 and 52. Myotonic dystrophy is discussed in questions 7 and 12.

      "explicacao": "This patient most likely has carotid sinus hypersensitivity, as suggested by the triggering of symptoms with head movement in the setting of a tight collar. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is defined by the occurrence of syncope associated with either a period of asystole of at least 3 seconds or a fall of at least 50 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, or both, in response to pressure on the carotid sinus. In another form of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, hypotension without bradycardia may occur. Triggers can include a tight collar, turning of the head, or even swallowing, though no identifiable triggers may be present. Symptoms and changes in heart rate and/or blood pressure can be reproduced with carotid sinus massage. Treatment is avoidance of triggers, but when recurrent, pacemaker insertion may be necessary. The carotid sinus, located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, is innervated by a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The carotid sinus contains specialized mechanoreceptors that are capable of detecting changes in blood pressure (baroreceptors) and heart rate. With stimulation, either mechanically (with applied pressure) or with elevations in blood pressure, mechanoreceptors send signals to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla leading to a reduction in sympathetic tone (leading to a further reduction in blood pressure) and an increase in parasympathetic tone (leading to a reduction in heart rate). Carotid sinus hypersensitivity results from an exaggerated response to baroreceptor stimulation. Vasovagal syncope is discussed in question 18; the absence of diaphoresis and nausea, and the presence of bradycardia, hypotension, and triggering by neck turning distinguish the two. Orthostatic hypotension, as most commonly occurs from dehydration leading to volume depletion and subsequent reduction in blood pressure with changes in posture, is usually preceded by warning symptoms such as light-headedness, which were not 835 present in this case. Severe aortic stenosis can lead to syncope, but bradycardia would not be present, and other associated symptoms would include chest pain and shortness of breath.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "This patient has McArdle’s disease, or glycogenosis type V. This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by myophosphorylase deficiency. This enzyme normally participates in the conversion of glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate; therefore, its deficiency will lead to glycogen accumulation and lack of glucose release from glycogen. The typical presentation is exercise- induced weakness and muscle cramps. The muscle cramps are physiologic contractures: they are electrically silent when an EMG needle is inserted into the contractured muscles (this forms the basis of the definition of true physiologic muscle contracture, in contrast to chronic shortening of a muscle and its tendon which, strictly speaking, is a pseudocontracture). Unlike normal muscles, when the muscle is exercised there is no production of lactic acid. On exertion, a sensation of fatigue may ensue; however, if the patient slows down or rests briefly, this sensation may disappear and the patient may be able to continue with the exercise. This is called a “second-wind phenomenon,” which is typically seen in McArdle’s disease, and results from mobilization and use of blood glucose. Tarui disease (glycogenosis type VII) is caused by phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency in muscle and erythrocytes. This enzyme participates in the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into glucose-1-phosphate, and therefore, it is similar to McArdle’s disease from the muscular standpoint. In addition, some patients may develop jaundice (due to hemolysis) and gouty arthritis due to PFK deficiency in erythrocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis distinguishes these two disorders. 836 Cori’s disease (glycogenosis type III) is caused by a deficiency in the debranching enzyme, leading to glycogen accumulation. These patients can present with a childhood form with liver disease and weakness or with an adult form characterized by myopathic weakness. Andersen’s disease (glycogenosis type IV) is caused by a deficiency in the glycogen branching enzyme, and is characterized by hepatomegaly from polysaccharide accumulation, cirrhosis, and liver failure. Pompe’s disease (glycogenosis type II) is caused by acid maltase deficiency and is discussed in question 48. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP. Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology. 10th ed.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "The patient depicted in question 15 is presenting in myasthenic crisis. In patients with signs of respiratory muscle involvement, negative inspiratory force and forced vital capacity should be monitored closely. Intubation and mechanical ventilation should be initiated when the negative inspiratory force is less than −30 cm of H 2 O, forced vital capacity less than 15 mL/kg, or if there is a significant downward trend of spirometry measures with clinical evidence of respiratory muscle fatigue. The patient should be admitted to the ICU and intubated and mechanically ventilated. In patients with significant oculobulbar symptoms, neck flexor weakness (suggesting potential involvement of respiratory muscles), or respiratory muscle weakness, initial treatment is with either intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) or plasmapheresis. Higher efficacy of one modality over the other has not been established and both are reasonable options. One is chosen over the other based on availability, cost, underlying medical conditions, or previous response. Medications that exacerbate myasthenia gravis include aminoglycosides, β-blockers, and neuromuscular blocking agents, among others. These should be avoided or used at the lowest 837 possible dose in myasthenia gravis; symptom exacerbation with initiation of any medication should prompt investigation as to whether or not the medication is the culprit. Penicillamine can cause a seropositive myasthenic syndrome. The majority of patients with myasthenia gravis, except some with purely ocular myasthenia, require immunosuppressive therapy. Patients are often treated with corticosteroids for several weeks to months until secondary immunosuppressive therapy has taken effect. Approximately one-third of patients will have worsening of their myasthenic symptoms at the onset of steroid therapy that lasts up to 10 days. Therefore, caution is required with the initiation of steroid therapy. When symptoms are severe, and there is concern for significant pharyngeal or respiratory muscle involvement, initiation of plasma exchange or IVIGs prior to starting corticosteroids may be necessary. Secondary immunosuppressive agents that may be used include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine. Their use helps reduce the need for steroids in the long term. Pyridostigmine provides symptomatic relief but does not modify the course of the illness. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are discussed in question 22. In the majority of patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis, thymic abnormalities are present, most commonly lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. In a minority of patients, benign thymoma is present, and rarely, malignant thymoma. Resection of the thymus (regardless of whether or not thymoma is present) can potentially induce remission of myasthenia gravis. In autoimmune myasthenia gravis, there are ongoing clinical trials to determine the utility of thymectomy. However, there is evidence that patients who undergo thymectomy are more likely to attain remission of their myasthenia gravis. Thymectomy is therefore recommended for patients with myasthenia gravis with symptom onset prior to the age of 60, especially in younger women who seem to show the most benefit. Response to resection may not be apparent for several months to years. Because myasthenic symptoms can worsen in the perioperative period, stabilization of symptoms with preoperative IVIGs or plasma exchange prior to operation may be indicated. 838 Cortese I, Chaudhry V, So YT, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with vasovagal syncope, a form of neurally mediated syncope or neurocardiogenic syncope. Syncope is a sudden transient loss of consciousness with a loss of postural tone. There are several causes of syncope; one of the most common causes is vasovagal syncope. It can have many potential triggers, with phlebotomy being a common one. This type of syncope results from a combination of inhibition of normal vascular sympathetic tone and increased vagal tone. Clinical features that suggest vasovagal syncope include preceding or concomitant diaphoresis, palpitations, and nausea. It is more common in women. The other options are all potential causes of syncope. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is characterized by severe pain in the hypopharynx and pharynx, tongue, and ear, with hypotension and bradycardia that when severe may be associated with syncope. It is often posttraumatic, but can occur with neck tumors as well. There are no features in the case to suggest glossopharyngeal neuralgia. A lack of postictal confusion and absence of convulsions helps distinguish syncope from seizures in this case. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is discussed in question 13; syncope in the latter disorder is triggered by maneuvers that increase pressure on the carotid sinus, such as a tight collar. A third ventricular tumor, such as a colloid cyst, can lead to syncope with postural changes if the change in posture leads to obstruction of the third ventricle, leading to increased intracranial pressure. The history in this case is more suggestive of vasovagal syncope. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012."

      "explicacao": "This patient has Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This condition is a dystrophinopathy, inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion, and is the most common genetic muscle disease, affecting 1 in 3,500 live male births. About a third of the cases are caused by spontaneous mutations in the dystrophin gene, so there may not be a positive family history. This condition presents early in life and manifests with weakness and delayed development of motor milestones. These children have frequent falls, and difficulty walking, running, and rising from supine and sitting positions. Weakness is significant in the proximal muscles, predominantly in the iliopsoas, quadriceps, and gluteals, as well as the shoulder girdle and upper limbs. It also tends to affect the pretibial muscles. These patients have pseudohypertrophy of the calves due to fibrosis. They also have scapular winging and contractures. Ocular, facial, and bulbar muscles are usually spared. Cardiac involvement includes arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. It is recommended that all patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy undergo cardiac evaluation, even if asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint. Mild developmental delay with a subnormal intelligence quotient (IQ) may be seen. These children become wheelchair or bed-bound, and may eventually die of respiratory failure and pulmonary infections. Creatine kinase values range from 10 to 100 times higher than normal. Needle EMG shows fibrillations, positive waves, and myopathic motor unit potentials. The muscle biopsy findings in Figure 10.1 indicate a muscular dystrophy, showing endomysial fibrosis, loss of muscle fibers with residual fibers of different sizes, some of which are very large and eosinophilic, and others very small and atrophic. Degeneration and regeneration, as well as necrosis and macrophage invasion, may also be seen. In general, myofiber necrosis, degeneration, regeneration, increased fiber size variation, endomysial inflammation, and fibrosis are collectively called dystrophic changes, which are characteristic for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but not specific, and can be seen in other dystrophies. Dystrophin is the affected gene product and is absent in patients with Duchenne. Dystrophin is a cytoplasmic protein that binds and 841 interacts with other intracytoplasmic proteins such as F-actin, and is linked to the trans-sarcolemmal dystroglycan protein complex, providing a structural link between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. If dystrophin is lost or altered, this sarcolemmal structure is affected, making it susceptible to rupture. The diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is made by genetic testing of the dystrophin gene or by absent dystrophin immunostaining on muscle biopsy. Becker’s muscular dystrophy is similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, it is much less severe, with a later onset (usually in adolescence or adulthood), which is not the case in this patient. Becker’s muscular dystrophy is discussed in questions 30 and 31. The other options are unlikely to be the correct diagnosis in this case.

      "explicacao": "This patient has Nonaka myopathy, which is an autosomal recessive distal myopathy, with onset in early adulthood. It is characterized by foot drop associated with weakness of the anterior tibial muscles. Eventually, muscles of the upper extremities are affected, especially the extensors. Involvement of more proximal muscles and bulbar muscles is rare. Histologically, the muscle biopsy shows rimmed vacuoles, and electron microscopy shows tubular filaments similar to those seen in inclusion body myositis, without inflammation. This condition is associated with a mutation in the GNE gene located on chromosome 9p. Welander muscular dystrophy is a distal myopathy inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with an onset later in adult life usually between 40 and 60 years of age (not consistent with this 842 case). Welander myopathy usually begins with weakness and atrophy in the distal muscles of the hands and later affects the legs. Muscle biopsy demonstrates myopathic changes and rimmed vacuoles. Markesbery–Griggs is also an autosomal dominant distal myopathy with onset later in adult life, caused by mutations in the gene encoding titin on chromosome 2q. It is characterized by foot drop and the later development of wrist drop and weakness of extensor muscles of the forearms. The biopsy findings are similar to those seen in Welander myopathy. Miyoshi myopathy (discussed in question 26) and Ullrich’s muscular dystrophy (discussed in question 53) are not consistent with this case. Cardamone M, Darras BT, Ryan MM.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, including pyridostigmine and neostigmine, inhibit acetylcholinesterase, increasing levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The most commonly used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in myasthenia gravis is pyridostigmine. It improves symptoms, but does not alter the course of the disease. Side effects are due to activation of muscarinic receptors outside of the NMJ, and include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and increased bronchial secretions. At therapeutic doses, pyridostigmine does not affect central cholinergic pathways, as it does not cross the blood–brain barrier. With excessive dosing, cholinergic crisis can occur, with paradoxical worsening of weakness, even leading to respiratory failure. Patients with myasthenia presenting with significant worsening of symptoms with respiratory involvement should be assessed for the possibility of cholinergic crisis rather than myasthenic crisis. Cholinergic crisis results from overstimulation of muscarinic receptors systemically due to overdosing with pyridostigmine. Symptoms that distinguish cholinergic crisis from 843 myasthenic crisis include the presence of nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, sialorrhea, excessive bronchial secretions, miosis, bradycardia, and diarrhea (see also Chapter 3 ).

These central cores run along the length of the muscle fiber, as opposed to multicore or minicore disease in which the cores are small, extending through only segments of the fiber length. Central core myopathy is an autosomal dominant disease, caused by a mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene RYR1 on chromosome 19q13.1. These patients are at risk for the development of malignant hyperthermia and this should be considered when general anesthesia is needed. The clinical presentation is that of weakness and hypotonia soon after birth, and subsequent delay in motor development. The weakness is predominantly proximal, and the pelvic girdle is usually more affected than the shoulder girdle. Facial, bulbar, and ocular muscles are usually spared.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination are consistent with an autonomic ganglionopathy, also known as acute pandysautonomia. Symptoms develop over weeks, as opposed to pure autonomic failure, in which symptoms develop slowly over time. Symptoms of autonomic ganglionopathy are due to dysfunction in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, and include orthostatic hypotension, absent heart rate variability (see question 47 on tilt table testing), hypohidrosis or anhidrosis, dry mouth and eyes, pupillary abnormalities, sexual dysfunction, early satiety, constipation, and diarrhea due to abnormal gastric and intestinal motility. It results from impairment of transmission of impulses in the autonomic ganglia and affects both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. In approximately half of patients, an antibody against the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor can be identified in the serum. Autonomic ganglionopathy can be either autoimmune or paraneoplastic, with small cell lung carcinoma being a common associated malignancy; these cannot definitively be distinguished between clinically, and the antibody can be present in either form. In patients with the autoimmune form, other autoimmune disorders may be present, and symptoms may be preceded by antecedent infectious illness. Treatment of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy includes plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins; typically, some improvement of symptoms occurs, but full recovery is unlikely. Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibodies are seen in autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Anti-striational muscle antibodies can be detected in patients with autoimmune myasthenia gravis or thymoma. Antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel are seen in Lambert–Eaton syndrome. Anti-Jo 1 antibodies are seen in polymyositis (discussed in question 35), but can be seen in dermatomyositis as well (discussed in question 33). In a patient without a known history of diabetes, autonomic neuropathy would unlikely be the sole manifestation of nervous system involvement from diabetes.

Becker’s muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder, which presents with weakness and involvement of the same muscle groups as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as with 849 pseudohypertrophy of the calves. However, patients with Becker’s muscular dystrophy present later in life, sometimes in childhood, but more frequently in adolescence or adulthood. Given the milder phenotype, these patients are able to ambulate beyond the second decade of life, cardiac involvement occurs but is less frequent, and intelligence quotient (IQ) is usually normal. Needle EMG shows fibrillations, positive waves, and polyphasic short motor unit potentials. The biopsy will detect similar findings as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (see questions 19 and 20); however, dystrophin is not absent in Becker’s muscular dystrophy, but structurally abnormal or present in a smaller than normal amount. Dystrophin is a cytoplasmic protein that binds and interacts with other intracytoplasmic proteins such as F-actin, and is linked to the trans-sarcolemmal dystroglycan protein complex, providing a structural link between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. If dystrophin is lost or altered, this sarcolemmal structure is affected, making it susceptible to rupture. The other options are not likely to be the diagnosis in this case.

Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory condition of the muscle associated with skin findings. The muscle weakness is a typical myopathic weakness, predominantly proximal. Therefore, the 850 patient will complain of being unable to stand from the sitting position, inability to walk up stairs, and difficulty lifting their arms above their head. Typical skin findings are the heliotrope rash (purplish discoloration of the eyelids), erythema of the face, neck, anterior chest, upper back, elbows and knees, Gottron’s papules (purplish scaly papular rash on the extensor surface of the hands), and “mechanic’s hands” (thickened skin on the dorsal and ventral surface of the hands). Serum creatine kinase levels may be normal or elevated. The muscle biopsy specimen shown in Figure 10.3 is characteristic for dermatomyositis, showing atrophic fibers in the borders of the fascicles, which is known as perifascicular atrophy. Dermatomyositis is associated with malignancy and therefore these patients should have age-appropriate malignancy screening. Dermatomyositis is also associated with interstitial lung disease, especially if the anti-Jo antibody is positive. Anti-Jo antibodies occur more commonly in polymyositis than dermatomyositis but can occur in either condition. The initial treatment of choice is steroids; however, long-term steroid-sparing agents may be required, such as azathioprine or methotrexate. As mentioned above, methotrexate may be associated with pulmonary toxicity, and therefore if there is interstitial lung disease, this medication should be avoided.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with pure autonomic failure, also known as Bradbury–Eggleston syndrome, which has been attributed to loss of intermediolateral cell column neurons. It results from deposition of α-synuclein in the autonomic nervous system. Pathologically, Lewy bodies are seen (see Chapter 12). It 851 presents in mid to late adulthood. In men, the earliest symptom is typically impotence. Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (defined as a reduction of systolic blood pressure by 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg, or both), or a pulse rate increase of 20 bpm, is present, and is often worse in the morning, after meals, exertion, and with heat exposure. Supine hypertension may occur as well. Other features include hypohidrosis, nocturia, early satiety and nausea (due to gastrointestinal hypomotility), urinary hesitance and/or urgency with occasional incontinence, and neck and shoulder aching (“coat hanger” distribution) precipitated by standing. In multiple system atrophy (discussed in Chapter 6 ), dysautonomia is typically more severe and disabling, and extrapyramidal or cerebellar findings are present on examination. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is discussed in questions 24 and 25. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy type I can lead to autonomic neuropathy (see Chapter 9 ), but the history and examination (specifically, absence of dissociated sensory loss on examination) make this less likely. This patient is not known to have diabetes, and a normal sensory examination further makes diabetic autonomic neuropathy unlikely. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

There are regenerating and necrotic fibers. These findings are characteristic of polymyositis, and neither rimmed vacuoles nor perifascicular atrophy is seen. Rimmed vacuoles are seen in inclusion body myositis. Perifascicular atrophy is seen in dermatomyositis. Polymyositis is an inflammatory condition of the muscle in which there are no skin findings. The weakness is proximal, and 852 this condition, similar to dermatomyositis, has been associated with interstitial lung disease, and anti-Jo antibody may be a marker of this association. On the other hand, polymyositis as opposed to dermatomyositis does not have a strong correlation with the presence of malignancy. The initial treatment of choice is steroids; however, in the long term, a steroid-sparing agent such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be required. A subset of patients with polymyositis has antibodies to various muscle components, including antibodies against cytoplasmic transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetases (anti-Jo 1), or against the tRNA itself. These antibodies occur in both polymyositis and dermatomyositis, but are more common in polymyositis. Greenberg SA. Inflammatory myopathies: evaluation and management. Semin Neurol. 2008;28:241–249.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Concomitant use of statins and fibrates increases the risk of muscle toxicity. Statins are lipid-lowering agents that inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3- methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). Statins are known to have muscle toxic effects, and the possible mechanism of this adverse effect is by an action on the mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, especially in type II muscle fibers. A mutation in the gene SLCO1B has been associated with predisposition to develop statin-induced myopathy (LDL receptor gene mutations cause disorders of lipid metabolism, which statins are used to treat). Various types of statin-related toxicities are seen: • Increased serum creatine kinase (CK) in entirely asymptomatic patients, with mild elevations and rarely up to 10 times the upper limit of normal. • Myalgia with or without increased serum CK levels. Usually, muscle strength is normal, and myalgias may improve after 853 discontinuation of the medication. • Muscle weakness with serum CK elevation. • Rhabdomyolysis. This is a rare but severe complication of statins. In this condition, the CK levels are markedly elevated, sometimes above 15,000 IU/L (normal up to 220 IU/L). These CK elevations could lead to myoglobinuria and renal failure, such as in this case. • Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM). Usually characterized by a rapid onset of severe proximal weakness, and CK levels of typically over 6,000 IU/L. Distal weakness and dysphagia may also occur. Weakness is progressive with rising CK levels despite discontinuation of statin. Antibodies against HMGCR have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. This is an aggressive myopathy and needs to be treated with immunosuppressive agents. NAM can also be associated with antibodies against signal recognition peptide (SRP), which is discussed further in question 67. Myotoxicity with statins increases with higher cholesterol- lowering potency of the statin, with higher statin dosages, and for statins with higher lipophilicity (the lipophilic statins include atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, whereas pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin are more hydrophilic). Concomitant use of fibrates can increase the risk of developing muscle toxicity. This risk can also be increased by the use of other drugs, such as azole antifungals, macrolides antibiotics, antiretrovirals, and amiodarone, among others. Therefore a careful assessment of the medications that the patient is taking is important when treating a patient with statins. Babu S, Li Y. Statin induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and tilt table test results are consistent with 854 postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), the most common form of dysautonomia. Tilt table examination is used to assess changes in heart rate and blood pressure that occur with changes in posture, increased vagal tone (as occurs with Valsalva), and sometimes, in response to the administration of pharmacologic agents such as the β-agonist isoproterenol. In POTS, tilt table examination shows an increase in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from baseline, or more than 120 bpm within 10 minutes of head-up tilt, without significant changes in blood pressure, but with symptoms of orthostasis such as light- headedness, palpitations, generalized weakness, visual changes, headache, or tremor. The etiology of POTS is unclear; it is more common in females, and symptoms worsen around menses, suggesting a role for estrogen in the pathophysiology. Symptom onset may follow a variety of triggers, including viral infection, pregnancy, or surgery, and for this reason, autoimmune causes have also been postulated. POTS can rarely be a manifestation of a mutation in a norepinephrine transporter gene, which leads to elevated plasma levels of norepinephrine, with subsequent sympathetic overactivity. POTS may be comorbid with chronic fatigue syndrome; the significance of this relationship is not clear. In some patients with POTS, the symptoms are mild and do not require treatment. In others, treatment may include β-blockers, increased fluid and salt intake, fludrocortisone, and midodrine. There is not a reduction in blood pressure in POTS, distinguishing it from orthostatic hypotension. With vasovagal response, there is no tachycardia but rather transient bradycardia due to parasympathetic overactivation. Systemic mastocytosis, a hematologic disorder in which mast cells are overactive, leading to excessive histamine release, can lead to POTS-like symptoms; skin changes such as flushing and an absence of clear postural component distinguish the two. Subclavian steal syndrome results in syncope in the setting of stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. With exercise of that arm, blood flow steal from the vertebral arteries and basilar artery may occur, resulting in syncope and other symptoms of basilar insufficiency. There is no indication in the case that the symptoms are secondary to subclavian steal phenomenon. 855 Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Cardiac involvement, including cardiomyopathy and conduction defects, is evident in various types of LGMDs, and screening for them is recommended even in asymptomatic patients. LMGDs are a group of muscular dystrophies in which there is proximal weakness with involvement of the shoulder or pelvic girdle with sparing of the facial muscles. It can present in both sexes, and the inheritance is either autosomal dominant or recessive. The mode of inheritance determines the current classification, which has mainly been based on the genetic defects and gene products involved. Regarding classification by inheritance, LGMD1 is autosomal dominant and LGMD2 is 857 autosomal recessive. Needle EMG shows myopathic changes. Muscle biopsy shows dystrophic changes, with myofiber necrosis, degeneration, regeneration, increased fiber size variation, endomysial inflammation, and fibrosis. Some LGMDs are associated with joint contractures, and early intervention with physical and occupational therapy to prevent contractures and preserve mobility and function is recommended. Available evidence suggests that strength and aerobic training are not harmful in LGMD and may be of benefit. It is recommended that pulmonary function testing occur once at diagnosis, and periodically on follow-up for the types of LGMD that may be associated with respiratory failure. Some types of LGMD are associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia and when maintenance of nutrition via the oral route is not possible, feeding tubes and other means of nutrition should be instituted as needed.

      "explicacao": "The history and examination of the patient depicted in question 43 are consistent with Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is a form of myasthenia. It is a neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorder resulting from antibodies against presynaptic P/Q- type voltage-gated calcium channel, reducing the influx of calcium that normally leads to release of acetylcholine into the NMJ. It is more common in males. As compared to autoimmune myasthenia gravis, it is less likely to involve ocular or bulbar musculature; it predominantly affects proximal (shoulder and hip girdle) and trunk musculature. Proximal leg weakness is a common clinical presentation of LEMS, and the weakness perceived by the patient may be out of proportion to the examination. While in LEMS, worsening of muscle weakness with repetitive muscle use ultimately occurs, there is a transient improvement of muscle strength following repetitive muscle use prior to worsening weakness. This can sometimes be elicited on physical examination as well as electrophysiologically. Also, unlike myasthenia gravis, in LEMS, deep tendon reflexes are often diminished or absent. Autonomic features are prominent in LEMS, including constipation, urinary retention, and impotence. LEMS may be either autoimmune or paraneoplastic; paraneoplastic LEMS is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer. A diagnosis of autoimmune LEMS should be made only after excluding an occult malignancy with an extensive evaluation and after long-term surveillance for malignancy. The SOX antibody has been identified as being a useful marker to distinguish between squamous cell lung cancer–associated paraneoplastic LEMS (in which SOX antibody is present) and autoimmune LEMS. Unlike myasthenia gravis, patients with LEMS respond little if at all to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Symptomatic treatment of LEMS may be achieved with 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), a drug that inhibits presynaptic potassium channels, prolonging depolarization and increasing acetylcholine vesicle exocytosis. Autoimmune LEMS is treated with immunosuppressive therapy, 860 including corticosteroids as well as steroid-sparing agents, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis. Response to these treatments is variable and is typically not as successful as in myasthenia gravis. In paraneoplastic LEMS, treatment of the malignancy may improve the neuromuscular symptoms. EMG shows low-amplitude CMAPs that increase in amplitude following brief exercise (as in Fig. 10.6 , in which there is a >50% increase in CMAP amplitude post exercise). This is a phenomenon known as facilitation. On high-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation, a prominent increment is seen, in contrast to the electrodecrement seen with low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation in myasthenia gravis (discussed in question 6 and Chapter 9 ). The history, examination, normal creatine kinase, and EMG/NCS findings make a myopathy or myositis unlikely. Similarly, a demyelinating polyneuropathy would have been detected on NCS, and facilitation of reflexes with both myopathies and demyelinating polyneuropathy does not occur.

The patient was previously healthy, now with an acute to subacute onset of symptoms, mildly elevated creatine kinase (CK) and markedly elevated eosinophils. The muscle biopsy demonstrates the presence of a parasite, confirming the diagnosis of trichinosis. Trichinosis is caused by the intestinal nematode Trichinella spiralis, which is transmitted by the ingestion of uncooked pork containing the encysted larvae. Once ingested, the larvae are liberated from the cysts in the gastrointestinal tract, developing into adult worms in the duodenum or jejunum. The female worms deposit batches of larvae in the intestinal wall, which migrate via 861 lymphatics into the bloodstream. These larvae invade all tissues, but survive only in muscles, where they become encysted and calcify. Patients develop a mild gastroenteritis on ingestion of infected meat. About 1 week later, and sometimes up to 4 to 6 weeks later, patients may experience low-grade fever, myalgias, fatigue, and edema of the conjunctiva and eyelids. Ocular muscle weakness occurs, resulting in strabismus and diplopia. Also, weakness of the tongue and masticatory as well as pharyngeal muscles occurs, which may cause dysarthria and dysphagia. Limb muscle weakness occurs, more prominent proximally. The diaphragm and cardiac muscles may also be involved. Myopathic symptoms eventually subside and patients generally improve completely. However, massive infections have been reported to cause CNS symptoms, including headaches, neck stiffness, and confusion. Laboratory studies demonstrate eosinophilia and moderate elevations of CK. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay blood test for trichinella becomes positive after 1 to 2 weeks and may be helpful. Muscle biopsy, such as in this case, as shown in Figure 10.7 , will demonstrate the parasite and sometimes an inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils. Treatment includes a combination of thiabendazole with steroids. Thiabendazole is an antihelminthic that prevents larval reproduction and interferes with the metabolism of the larvae in the muscle. Albendazole is also effective. Lyme and HIV usually cause a neuropathy. Rarely myopathy can be seen with HIV, Lyme, or toxoplasmosis but it is not associated with eosinophilia, as is typical of trichinosis.

Neonatal forms present with dysmorphic features, contractures, arthrogryposis, generalized hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory problems. There are other intermediate forms with infantile-onset, childhood- and adolescent-onset forms. This condition is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion. It can be caused by mutations in several genes that encode for various muscle proteins such as α-actin, α-tropomyosin, and β- tropomyosin, nebulin, troponin, and cofilin. Histopathologically, the fibers have rod-like structures that are seen beneath the sarcolemma, also known as nemaline bodies or nemaline rods. Type I fibers are smaller than normal and predominate.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Normally, with assumption of an upright posture, there is a transient reduction in blood pressure that is soon counteracted by an increase in heart rate (not bradycardia) mediated by inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic, renal, and skeletal muscle blood vessels vasoconstrict. The increase in heart rate is maximal at the 15th beat and a mild reflex bradycardia is noted at the 30th beat. In moderate or severe autonomic neuropathy, the compensatory increase in heart rate does not occur. Upright tilt table evaluation is used to obtain objective measures of blood pressure and heart rate in various postures. In normal individuals, during the tilt table test, at 60 to 80 degrees of tilting for 10 minutes, there is a brief 5 to 15 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure, a 5 to 10 mm Hg increase in diastolic blood 863 pressure, and a 10 to 15 bpm increase in heart rate. If there is early, gradual, and sustained hypotension (>20 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure) without compensatory tachycardia, this is an indication of insufficient sympathetic tone and impaired baroreceptor function. Hypotension with compensatory tachycardia suggests hypovolemia. If hypotension is delayed for several minutes but then occurs abruptly with bradycardia, this is more suggestive of a neurocardiogenic mechanism. Most neurogenic causes of syncope lead to hypotension that occurs within the first 5 to 10 minutes of tilting, without a compensatory tachycardia. The thermoregulatory sweat test is a test of sudomotor function; it is a qualitative test of sweating in which an indicator powder is applied to the subject who is then exposed to elevated temperatures. Sweat interacts with the powder, and the distribution pattern of the powder indicates areas of normal sweating and identifies areas of absent or reduced sweating. Different patterns of hypo- or anhidrosis can be identified that correspond to different autonomic disorders. In large and small fiber neuropathies, distal anhidrosis occurs. In patients with multiple system atrophy (see Chapter 6 ), pure autonomic failure (discussed in question 34), and autonomic neuropathies, global hypohidrosis or anhidrosis occurs. The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test is another test of sudomotor function. A sweat cell is applied to the skin and an electric current is then applied. Acetylcholine is iontophoresed into the skin, stimulating sweat glands. Sweat production is measured from adjacent sweat glands that are stimulated via an axon reflex. If there is a low or absent response following application of the electric current, this indicates a lesion of the postganglionic sympathetic axon. Bolis CL, Licinio J, Govoni S.

      "explicacao": "The patients depicted in questions 48 and 49, have glycogenosis type II or acid maltase deficiency. Acid maltase deficiency, or glycogenosis type II, is an autosomal recessive condition caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid maltase (also known as α-1,4-glucosidase). This enzyme participates in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose; its deficiency leads to glycogen accumulation, causing the typical histopathologic findings on muscle biopsy: vacuolated sarcoplasm with glycogen accumulation that stains strongly with acid phosphatase. There are three forms of acid maltase deficiency: 1. Pompe’s disease is the infantile form that presents in the first few months of life with difficulty feeding, cyanosis, dyspnea, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly, and hypotonic weakness. This form progresses rapidly and patients die in the first few months. 2. Childhood form, which has an onset in the second year of life, manifests with proximal weakness, motor developmental delay, hypotonia, enlarged calves, and rarely with cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, and mental retardation. These patients may die of pulmonary infections and respiratory failure. 3. Adult form, which presents in the second to fourth decades of life, manifests with slowly progressive proximal weakness and typically weakness of the diaphragm, leading to neuromuscular respiratory problems. These patients do not typically have cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, or mental retardation. Glycogenosis type V is McArdle’s disease. Glycogenosis type III is Cori’s disease.

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "865 This patient’s history and examination are consistent with congenital myasthenia due to congenital acetylcholine receptor deficiency, a congenital myasthenic syndrome. The congenital myasthenic syndromes are a genetically heterogeneous group of neuromuscular junction disorders. They most commonly present at birth, but some forms do not present until childhood or early adulthood. They are more common in males. The typical presentation is one of ophthalmoparesis and ptosis in infancy, with facial diparesis. Limb weakness and hypotonia are often present, and respiratory involvement is rare but can occur. As in autoimmune myasthenia gravis, in some forms of congenital myasthenia, intravenous administration of edrophonium (a peripheral reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) transiently improves symptoms, and there is symptomatic benefit from oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as well. Because the congenital myasthenic syndromes are not immune-mediated, there is no response to immunosuppressive therapy or thymectomy. Electrophysiologic findings are similar to other neuromuscular disorders, showing a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation studies and increased jitter on single-fiber EMG. The most common form of congenital myasthenia, congenital acetylcholine receptor deficiency, is due to an autosomal recessive or sporadic mutation in the acetylcholine receptor gene. Acetylcholinesterase deficiency is another congenital myasthenic syndrome that presents with axial and respiratory weakness in early infancy. Characteristically, patients have a delayed pupillary response to direct light. Due to deficiency of the enzyme, these patients do not respond to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as edrophonium or pyridostigmine. In newborns of mothers with autoimmune myasthenia gravis, transient myasthenic symptoms can occur due to transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus in utero. Signs of neonatal myasthenia include hypotonia and poor feeding, with symptoms improving typically within the first 2 weeks of life. This patient’s symptoms and examination findings are still present at 6 months of age, and absence of evidence of a neuromuscular disorder in the patient’s mother makes this less likely. Other disorders that can lead to ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, and 866 generalized weakness in infancy include mitochondrial disorders, botulism, and congenital myopathies, but the presence of fluctuating weakness and response to edrophonium distinguish congenital myasthenia from these.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "The parasympathetic nervous system can be divided into cranial and sacral portions ( Fig. 10.9 ). The cranial portion includes fibers that originate in brain stem nuclei and are relayed to their target sites via four cranial nerves: (1) oculomotor, (2) facial, (3) glossopharyngeal, and (4) vagus. In the parasympathetic nervous system, the ganglia are located close to the target site, with long preganglionic fibers and short postganglionic fibers. Cells located in S2 to S4 of the spinal cord give rise to the sacral portion of the parasympathetic nervous system and innervate the genitourinary system and distal colon. The neurotransmitter for all sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic fibers is acetylcholine that acts at nicotinic receptors in the ganglia. Parasympathetic postganglionic neurons predominantly release acetylcholine. The parasympathetic nervous system leads to vasodilation, bradycardia, production of bronchial secretions, gastric acid production, lacrimation, salivation, pupillary constriction, and erection. The intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord, present from T1 to L2, contains the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. Small myelinated preganglionic fibers known as white rami communicantes exit the intermediolateral cell column and synapse on sympathetic ganglia located in the paravertebral region. Postganglionic fibers known as gray rami communicantes are carried through spinal nerves T1 to T4 to supply thoracic regions and T5 to L2 to supply various subdiaphragmatic end organs including blood vessels, gastrointestinal organs, and genitourinary tract ( Fig. 10.9 ; sympathetic innervation to the head is carried by C8-T2, see questions 55 and 56 and Fig. 10.10 ). The neurotransmitter released from postganglionic sympathetic fibers is norepinephrine, except in sweat glands, where acetylcholine is released and acts at muscarinic receptors. In the sympathetic nervous system, preganglionic fibers are short and postganglionic fibers are long. 869 Figure 10.9 Schematic of the autonomic nervous system.

      "explicacao": "Horner’s syndrome results from a lesion in the sympathetic pathways ( Fig. 10.10 ; see also Fig. 1.6 ). The sympathetic tracts originate in the hypothalamus and descend in the lateral brain stem to synapse with sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral cell column in the spinal cord that is present from spinal segment T1 to L2. The face receives sympathetic innervation from intermediolateral cells at the C8 to T2 level. Preganglionic fibers synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. Postganglionic fibers travel along the common carotid artery. At the carotid bifurcation, fibers to the sphincter pupillae of the eye travel with the ICA, and are involved in pupillary dilation. Fibers to Muller’s smooth 871 muscles in the upper eyelid are also carried along this route. Sympathetic fibers destined for the eccrine glands of the face travel along the ECA. Horner’s syndrome, or oculosympathetic paresis, results from a lesion to the sympathetic pathways. Features include ptosis, due to loss of innervation of Muller’s smooth muscle, miosis, due to loss of innervation of the pupillary dilator muscle, apparent enophthalmos, due to lack of input to the lid retractors (the eye appears sunken, though it is not), and loss of ciliospinal reflex (absence of pupillary constriction when painful stimulation is applied to the cervical region ipsilateral to the lesion). In preganglionic lesions, such as those occurring from medullary infarction, during thoracotomy, or with large lung masses that impinge on the preganglionic fibers as they course toward the superior cervical ganglion, facial anhidrosis occurs as well. Lesions in the region of the ICA (such as ICA dissection) spare the fibers destined for the eccrine glands of the face (traveling with the ECA), and anhidrosis does not occur. The patient in question 55 has a Horner’s syndrome, and in the setting of smoking, chronic cough and the findings on examination, this suggests that this is due to an apical lung mass, or Pancoast tumor. The presence of anhidrosis makes an ICA dissection unlikely because fibers to facial sweat glands travel along the ECA. The patient in question 56 has an ICA dissection, and because the lesion is distal to branching of the sweat fibers to the face (which are, again, carried along the ECA), anhidrosis will not occur (see also Chapter 1 for further information on how lesions in different areas of the sympathetic pathways can be distinguished). The ptosis and pupillary abnormalities seen in Horner’s syndrome can be distinguished from a third nerve palsy by the presence of intact extraocular movements of cranial nerve III- innervated muscles (medial rectus, inferior oblique, superior rectus, and inferior rectus). In addition, with loss of sympathetic innervation to the pupil, the anisocoria will be more prominent in dim light, as the contralateral (normal) eye will normally dilate, whereas the eye that has lost sympathetic innervation will remain miotic. The miotic eye will still normally constrict to light and accommodation (because parasympathetics are not impaired). 872 Levator dehiscence is a common cause of ptosis in older adults, but pupillary involvement and the other features of Horner’s syndrome would not occur.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Penile erection is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system and ejaculation by the sympathetic nervous system. In detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, the detrusor muscle contracts against an unrelaxed urethral sphincter. The internal urethral sphincter is under sympathetic control. Micturition (urination) has both voluntary and involuntary components. Voluntary contraction of the external urethral sphincter is mediated by sympathetic innervation derived from the intermediolateral cell column in the spinal cord at the level of L1 and L2 (see Fig. 10.9 ). The detrusor muscle is under involuntary control by the parasympathetic nervous system. The pontine micturition center regulates the detrusor reflex. Nerve roots S2 to S4 relay afferent sensory information from the genitourinary system, bladder, and anorectal area to the spinal cord. Onuf’s nucleus at S2 to S4 contains the cell bodies of neurons that control 874 the urethral and anal sphincters. Somatic efferents to the skeletal muscles of the pelvic floor arise from these cells and are carried by the pudendal nerves. Normally, individuals are able to maintain voluntary control over micturition through the medial frontal micturition centers located in the paracentral lobules (the medial continuation of the precentral gyrus). At the initiation of voluntary micturition, the detrusor reflex, which is mediated by spinal cord circuits, is initiated by voluntary external urethral sphincter relaxation and involuntary relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter with detrusor contraction. If the external urethral sphincter is voluntarily contracted during micturition, the detrusor muscle involuntarily relaxes and micturition stops. Urinary incontinence can result from lesions along various areas of the neuraxis. With lesions of the cauda equina (discussed in Chapter 11 ), a flaccid bladder results from loss of detrusor tone, sensation of bladder fullness is lost, and voluntary control over urination is lost. Overflow incontinence may occur; these patients often require intermittent self-catheterization chronically. With lesions affecting the paracentral lobule, such as hydrocephalus or tumors, voluntary control over the external urethral sphincter is lost. Lesions above the conus medullaris lead initially to a flaccid bladder leading to urinary retention with or without overflow incontinence. Some time after a spinal cord lesion, the bladder may become hyperreflexic. Urge incontinence results from overactive detrusor contraction; this is a frequent occurrence in patients with multiple sclerosis, though flaccid bladder with requirements for intermittent catheterization can also occur. Penile erection is mediated by parasympathetic fibers derived from S3 and S4 and carried by the pudendal nerve. Ejaculation is a sympathetically mediated reflex arc: the afferent pathway is via the dorsal nerve of the penis and pudendal nerve to S3 and S4, and the efferent pathway includes the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. A common way to remember this innervation is “Point (Parasympathetics cause erection) and Shoot (Sympathetics cause ejaculation).” Blumenfield H. Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases. 2nd ed.

      "explicacao": "Hirschsprung’s disease is due to congenital absence of the myenteric plexus. The enteric nervous system consists of the myenteric (or Auerbach’s) plexus that is located between the outer and inner smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract and the submucous (or Meissner’s) plexus, which is located between the circular muscle layer and the mucosa. The myenteric plexus is predominantly involved in gut motility, whereas the submucous plexus is involved in secretory functions. Together, the myenteric and submucous plexus control the function of the gastrointestinal tract. Hirschsprung’s disease is due to maldevelopment of the myenteric plexus with congenital absence. Most commonly, focal congenital absence of the myenteric plexus in the internal anal sphincter or rectosigmoid junction occurs, though in rare cases, the myenteric plexus may be absent throughout the gastrointestinal system. Segments of the colon that lack myenteric plexus cannot relax, leading to fecal retention and distention of proximal colonic segments. Some cases of Hirschsprung’s disease are due to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessel TM. Principles of Neural Science. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2000.

There are two types of myotonia congenita: Thomsen’s disease, which is autosomal dominant, and Becker’s disease, which is autosomal recessive. This group of disorders is caused by a channelopathy secondary to mutations in the voltage-dependent chloride channel gene CLCN1 on chromosome 7q. The main manifestation is myotonia, which is an impaired muscle relaxation as seen when the patients cannot relax their handgrip after grasping an object, and also manifested on percussion, leading to contraction and delayed relaxation. Myotonic potentials can be detected on EMG. In myotonia congenita, as opposed to paramyotonia, there is a “warm-up” phenomenon, in which the myotonia improves after repetitive muscle activation. Thomsen’s disease, as mentioned above, is allelic to Becker’s disease but mutations in the CLCN1 gene associated with Thomsen’s disease are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It begins in the first decade of life manifesting with painless myotonia, but not weakness, and is milder than the recessive form. Becker’s disease is the recessive form that presents later, usually in 877 the second decade of life, is more severe than the dominant form, and may manifest with weakness after severe episodes of myotonia.

CIM can occur independently or in combination with critical illness polyneuropathy (CIPN). The typical presentation is a flaccid weakness, which is diffuse and involves not only limb muscles but also the diaphragm, making these patients difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation. CIM occurs in severely ill patients, usually with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and with risk factors including hyperglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, sepsis, exposure to steroids, neuromuscular blocking agents, and certain antibiotics. Electrophysiologic studies show SNAPs greater than 80% of the lower limit of normal and low-amplitude CMAPs, as well as myopathic findings on needle EMG. Pathologically, there is type II fiber atrophy and characteristic loss of thick myosin filaments. CIPN presents in patients with similar risk factors as described above for CIM, and is characterized by the presence of axonal degeneration of motor and sensory fibers, as detected electrophysiologically by low SNAPs and CMAPs. Needle EMG may demonstrate neurogenic changes. The management of these conditions begins with the treatment of the underlying cause and avoidance of risk factors.

In a subset of patients, IBM may be comorbid with diabetes and various autoimmune disorders. Unlike other inflammatory myopathies, an association with malignancy has not been clearly demonstrated. 879 The histopathologic features of IBM are shown in Figure 10.5 and discussed in questions 39–40. Clinical manifestations include painless progressive weakness that is more distal in the arms and proximal and distal in the legs. Involvement of the finger flexors and flexor pollicis longus, leading to thumb flexion weakness, with relative preservation of finger abductors (the dorsal interossei) is a classic finding of IBM (see Fig. 10.8 ), although it does not occur in all patients. In contrast to dermatomyositis and polymyositis, deltoid strength is typically preserved in IBM. Nonaka myopathy (discussed in question 21) shows similar histopathologic features to IBM but is hereditary and noninflammatory. In addition in Nonaka myopathy, the pattern of weakness is more distal.

Some statin-associated necrotizing myopathies are caused by antibodies directed at 3- hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase, as discussed in question 36. Another type of necrotizing myopathy is marked by the presence of anti-signal recognition peptide (anti- SRP) antibodies. Presence of anti-SRP antibodies is often associated with statin use, though in such cases, the muscle pathology has been attributed to autoantibody-mediated processes rather than direct toxic effects of the statin on the muscle. Thus, discontinuation of the statin does not typically lead to resolution of the signs/symptoms. Autoimmune necrotizing myopathy associated with presence of anti-SRP antibodies can also occur in the absence 880 of statin exposure, and in such cases may be either a primary autoimmune process or associated with underlying malignancy. Clinically, immune-mediated myopathies present with subacute onset of predominantly proximal muscle weakness (though distal muscle groups can also be involved), often with muscle pain/tenderness and elevated creatine kinase. In anti–SRP- associated necrotizing myopathy, myonecrosis but with little or no evidence of inflammation may be seen. EMG shows fibrillation potentials at rest, increased insertional activity, short-duration polyphasic potentials, and spontaneous and positive sharp waves. Treatment is with immunosuppression.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history and examination, including evidence of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, are suggestive of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, but also the motor cortex and brainstem. Sporadic ALS affects men more than women. It can present at any age but with a peak incidence in the sixth to seventh decade of life. The hallmark of ALS is evidence of both upper motor neuron disease (such as hyperreflexia, clonus, and presence of a Babinski sign) and lower motor neuron disease (atrophy, fasciculations in the limbs, trunk, tongue, and occasionally face) in the absence of sensory symptoms or sensory abnormalities on examination. Clinical presentation is variable but most often muscle weakness begins focally, usually in the extremities (two-thirds of cases) and spreads to involve contiguous regions, though there is significant variability in the pattern of motor weakness. The split-hand phenomenon is a feature of ALS, characterized by weakness and atrophy of the lateral hand (thenar and first dorsal interosseous muscles) with relative sparing of the medial hand (hypothenar) muscles. Approximately one-third of patients present with bulbar symptoms, such as dysarthria or dysphagia (bulbar-onset ALS). Other symptoms of bulbar involvement include sialorrhea. Pseudobulbar palsy (pathologic laughter and crying without a corresponding change in mood) and excessive yawning also occur 905 in ALS and do not necessarily suggest an alternative diagnosis. Muscle cramps commonly occur. Only a minority of ALS patients (approximately 1%) present with acute respiratory failure, though the majority progress to respiratory failure. Cognitive impairment of some degree is present in up to 50% of patients with ALS; it is mostly subclinical, but can be detected on neuropsychological testing. In a small proportion of cases, the cognitive dysfunction is more evident, manifesting as a dementia that is typically of the frontotemporal type, namely frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This tends to occur most frequently in patients who present with bulbar-onset ALS. On the other hand, a subset of patients presenting with FTD have clinical and electrodiagnositic features of motor neuron disease. The pathology of patients with so-called ALS-FTD includes atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes and ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43–positive, tau-negative inclusions. Autosomal dominant forms have been linked to TDP-43 gene mutations on chromosome 9. The C9orf72 mutation on chromosome 9 is likely the most common cause of familial FTD- ALS. The region of motor neurons in the sacral spinal cord that are responsible for sphincter control, Onufrowicz’s nucleus (also known as Onuf’s nucleus) is generally spared in ALS, and sphincter dysfunction is typically not a prominent problem. Sensory nerve involvement and dysautonomia are also uncommon in ALS although they can occur. ALS is relentlessly progressive and ultimately fatal within 2 to 5 years of symptom onset, although in approximately 20%, survival is longer than 5 to 10 years after symptom onset. Primary lateral sclerosis (discussed in question 6), progressive muscular atrophy (discussed in question 10), Kennedy’s disease (X- linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy, discussed in question 33), and spinal muscular atrophy (discussed in question 35) are all motor neuron disorders. In these disorders, either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons alone are affected, but not in combination as in ALS. In early ALS, however, combined UMN and LMN dysfunction may be subtle or absent until later stages, when its presence is necessary for diagnosis (by definition; see question 31). In Kennedy’s disease there is often a family history of motor 906 neuron disease in males and gynecomastia is present on examination. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Spinal cord infarct may be sudden in onset and usually affects the anterior cord (anterior spinal artery), causing primarily bilateral weakness and pain and temperature loss rather than vibration and position loss (dorsal columns are relatively spared). Acute transverse myelitis progresses over hours or a few days rather than weeks or months. A metastatic tumor usually has a more subacute presentation with prominent back pain. Since metastatic tumors develop more rapidly, the patient would have more symptoms and neurologic deficits than this patient has for the degree of compression seen on this MRI. An epidural hematoma also presents rapidly with an acute compressive myelopathy syndrome manifesting as spinal shock, usually with no evidence of spasticity or hyperreflexia on presentation.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "Parotid and submandibular botulinum toxin injections are effective in some patients with ALS with refractory sialorrhea, and should be offered when appropriate. Guidelines have been issued by the American Academy of Neurology to guide the management of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The majority of patients experience hypoventilation, and orthopnea becomes significant in advanced stages. Nocturnal oximetry, supine forced vital capacity, and supine maximal inspiratory pressure should be periodically assessed in ALS patients. Noninvasive ventilation should be offered as indicated, and likely improves quality of life. Frequent evaluation of swallowing function is important as ALS patients are at increased risk of aspiration. Placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tube stabilizes body weight and maintains hydration in ALS patients; although survival is probably not prolonged significantly, quality of life is improved. Pharmacologic treatment of ALS may include riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release, which slows disease progression, prolonging survival by approximately 3 months. Patients may experience side effects of dizziness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal upset, which are usually mild and transient; if intolerable, dosage can be reduced or taken with food prior to deciding to discontinue it. Importantly, blood counts and liver enzymes should be checked routinely 1 month after beginning riluzole, monthly for 3 months, then every 3 months for the rest of the first year, and yearly afterward. Other treatments currently being investigated as disease-modifying therapies include: ibudilast, autologous bone marrow stem cells, interleukin-2, and diaphragmatic stimulation. Current management is largely symptomatic. Dextromethorphan–quinidine combination is used for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect. Management of ALS patients in multidisciplinary clinics, 908 including experts in neurology, speech therapy, physical and occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, social work, and case management is likely of benefit.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels should be obtained when following patients with B12 deficiency receiving treatment. Vitamin B12 or cobalamin deficiency is a major cause of neurologic disease. Manifestations include subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, peripheral neuropathy, optic neuropathy and even cognitive impairment. Vitamin B12 as methylcobalamin is a cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is then adenylated to S-adenosylmethionine. S- adenosylmethionine is required for methylation reactions, and decreased levels may lead to reduced myelin basic protein methylation and white matter vacuolization. Methionine also facilitates the formation of formyltetrahydrofolate, which is involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis, and therefore low methionine levels secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency impair DNA synthesis. In another pathway, vitamin B12 as adenosylcobalamin is a cofactor in the conversion from methylmalonyl CoA to 909 succinyl-CoA. Vitamin B12 deficiency will lead to the accumulation of methylmalonate and propionate, providing abnormal substrates for fatty acid synthesis, and therefore interfering with myelin synthesis. In some cases of vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin B12 levels may be within normal limits. However, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine will be elevated, helping in the diagnosis. Malabsorption is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, and achlorhydria in the setting of pernicious anemia is an important cause. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition in which anti-intrinsic factor and antiparietal antibodies may be present. Given that these patients have achlorhydria, gastrin levels may be elevated as well. Parenteral vitamin B12 supplementation is the treatment of choice in cases of malabsorption, and usually the hematologic abnormalities improve rapidly. However, the neurologic manifestations may not resolve completely. Vitamin B12 levels rise with treatment, regardless of the clinical effect, therefore MMA and homocysteine levels should be followed.

      "explicacao": "Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is characterized by presence of upper motor neuron signs at least 3 years from symptom onset without evidence of lower motor neuron dysfunction. PLS is considered along the spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) although it is controversial as to whether or not it is a separate entity. It typically presents in the sixth decade of life with a progressive spastic tetraparesis and later, cranial nerve involvement. Rarely, bulbar onset occurs. Spasticity, rather than muscle weakness or atrophy, is the most prominent feature. It typically progresses slowly over years. Autonomic involvement does not typically occur. Autopsy in patients with PLS has shown significant cell loss in layer 5 of the motor and premotor cortex, predominantly the large pyramidal Betz cells with corticospinal tract degeneration. The majority of ALS patients who present with predominantly upper motor neuron signs and symptoms eventually 910 develop lower motor neuron involvement by 3 to 4 years. The differential diagnosis of PLS is broad and a thorough workup to exclude any possibilities is indicated. It includes cervical myelopathy, although sensory abnormalities and other features of myelopathy such as bowel and bladder symptoms should be present, and normal MRI of the spine excludes this. Similarly, multiple sclerosis is high on the differential diagnosis of PLS; the presence of sensory symptoms, changes on MRI of the brain and spine, and CSF findings (when CSF is available for analysis), distinguishes between the two. Tropical spastic paraparesis due to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) typically occurs in endemic regions (equatorial and South Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Asia, Central and South America) and rarely in the United States. Patients with hereditary spastic paraparesis often, though not always, have a family history of similar symptoms and signs, and have white matter abnormalities on MRI of the brain and spine. Another condition in the differential diagnosis is stiff person syndrome, which is associated with antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, which should be assessed for in a patient with this presentation. Other disorders that can present with spastic quadriparesis that should be considered include hexosaminidase A deficiency, adrenomyeloneuropathy, a paraneoplastic process, and autoimmune processes (such as Sjogren’s syndrome). Treatment of PLS is symptomatic, and usually includes baclofen (a GABA B agonist) or tizanidine (an α 2 -agonist) to reduce spasticity. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

This population of patients should undergo an evaluation for various infectious agents as the potential cause of the myelopathy, including syphilis, viruses such as herpes zoster and HTLV-1, mycobacteria, and fungal agents. However, the most common cause of spinal cord involvement in HIV patients is primary HIV-related myelopathy. 911 This is a vacuolar myelopathy in which there is lateral and posterior column demyelination with microvacuolar changes and axonal preservation. Given that other potential conditions can cause myelopathic symptoms in patients with HIV, the HIV-related vacuolar myelopathy should be a diagnosis of exclusion. HIV-related vacuolar myelopathy presents in patients with AIDS, and affected patients have gradually progressive gait difficulty, spasticity, leg weakness, and impaired proprioception. There is no back pain and the upper extremities are typically spared. MRI reveals spinal cord atrophy, but more often is normal. There is no effective treatment, and the initial goal is prevention with antiretroviral therapy. HTLV-1 is a cause of spinal cord involvement in patients with HIV, however is not the cause of HIV-related vacuolar myelopathy. HTLV-1 causes tropical spastic paraparesis or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. This is a chronic progressive myelopathy endemic in equatorial and South Africa, as well as in parts of Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. This virus can be transmitted via contaminated blood, sexual activity, breastfeeding, and rarely in utero. Only 1% to 2% of infected individuals will develop neurologic disease.

It is inherited most commonly in an autosomal dominant fashion, but it can occur in an autosomal recessive fashion, while X-linked and sporadic cases have also been reported. This condition can present at any age from childhood to late adulthood, however more frequently the onset is between the second and fourth decades of life. Clinically it has been divided in pure and complicated forms. The pure form presents only with lower extremity spasticity, while sensory and other neurologic functions are intact. The complicated form has other neurologic features, including optic neuropathy, deafness, amyotrophy, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, dementia, mental retardation, and extrapyramidal dysfunction. Several genetic mutations have been identified involving various HSP loci and genes. The most common mutation is in chromosome 2p22 involved with the SPAST gene encoding for the protein spastin, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Other proteins involved include atlastin, paraplegin, spartin and maspardin, among others.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "Progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) is considered along the spectrum of ALS, although this is controversial; it is a motor neuron disease that affects only the lower motor neurons, distinguishing it from ALS, which affects both upper and lower motor neurons. It often presents with focal asymmetric distal weakness that later involves more proximal regions and other extremities, with lower motor neuron features on examination such as atrophy, hyporeflexia, and fasciculations. PMA begins at an earlier age as compared to ALS, and survival is often longer than ALS, with a median survival of 5 years though more rapidly progressive and more chronic forms of the disease occur. Bulbar 914 and respiratory involvement occurs later in the disease as compared to ALS. Laboratory evaluation may reveal moderately elevated creatine kinase, but never more than 10 times normal, and EMG shows evidence of motor neuron disease. Patients with ALS can present with predominantly lower motor neuron features early in their disease, with upper motor neuron findings not occurring until later. Therefore, a diagnosis of PMA is usually reserved for patients who have electrodiagnostic evidence of motor neuron disease and have isolated lower motor neuron findings at least 3 years from symptom onset. The polio virus infects anterior horn cells, leading to a lower motor neuron pattern of weakness similar to PMA. In those who survive, a post-polio syndrome may emerge years after recovery, marked by progressive fatigue, and weakness in muscles previously affected minimally or seemingly not at all. The history provided in this case is not consistent with post-polio syndrome. Unlike PMA, which progresses, on average, over 3 to 5 years, adult-onset spinal muscular atrophy is even more indolent and often affects predominantly proximal muscles. Inclusion body myositis is on the differential diagnosis of PMA and has a very indolent onset; relatively selective weakness of deep finger flexors and knee extensors in the setting of normal or only slightly elevated (less than two times normal) serum creatine kinase, should prompt workup for this disorder, including EMG and muscle biopsy.

The blood supply to the spinal cord is provided by an arterial network which runs longitudinally along the cord, and its core is comprised of one anterior and two posterior spinal arteries. The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, and originates from the vertebral arteries just before they join to form the basilar artery. The two paired posterior spinal arteries supply the posterior third of the spinal cord, and originate from the vertebral arteries as well. These three arteries receive 915 contributions from multiple segmental and radicular arteries, which arise from intercostal and iliac arteries, these originating from the aorta and iliac arteries. The largest radicular artery is the artery of Adamkiewicz, which supplies the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions of the spinal cord. The cervical and upper thoracic regions receive multiple collaterals from the vertebral arteries and other cervical vessels. Similarly, the conus medullaris and cauda equina are also richly vascularized from the contribution of multiple radicular arteries. There is a watershed region in between these two well-perfused regions located between T4 and T8. Between the anterior and posterior spinal circulations there is a circumferential network as well. There are anterior and posterior venous systems which drain into radicular veins and eventually into the epidural venous plexus system. This epidural venous plexus is a valveless system and extends from the pelvic region to the intracranial venous system.

      "explicacao": "The spinal cord has ascending and descending pathways distributed in the white matter funiculi. The corticospinal tract originates from the primary motor cortex. Approximately 85% of the fibers decussate at the level of the pyramids and descend on the lateral funiculi as the lateral corticospinal tract. Fifteen percent of the fibers descend uncrossed as the anterior corticospinal tract. The dorsal columns of the spinal cord are formed by the fasciculi of gracilis and cuneatus, both carrying information related to vibration and proprioception. These fasciculi ascend ipsilaterally to the nucleus gracilis and cuneatus in the dorsal medulla. Fibers from these nuclei form the medial lemniscus which decussates in the 916 brainstem and ascend to the thalamus. Sensation of pain, temperature, and crude touch is carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract. Peripheral sensory fibers enter the cord through the dorsal rami and cross over 2 to 3 segments to the contralateral spinal cord where they enter the lateral spinothalamic tract. They then ascend to synapse in the thalamus. The anterior spinal artery provides blood supply to the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, perfusing the areas containing the corticospinal tracts and the spinothalamic tracts, but sparing the dorsal columns supplied by the posterior spinal arteries. Therefore, an anterior spinal artery infarct will manifest with paraplegia below the level of the infarct, as well as loss of sensation to pain and temperature, but spares the sensation to vibration and proprioception. Option c can be produced by an infarct in the posterior spinal arteries territory, which is uncommon. Option e is consistent with Brown-Séquard (hemisection) syndrome, with ipsilateral loss of motor function and sensation to vibration and proprioception below the level of the lesion, and contralateral loss of sensation to pain and temperature. This happens because the lesion affects the spinothalamic tract after its decussation, and the corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns before the decussation. Options b and d are not likely possible in the setting of this patient. Blumenfeld H. Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases. 1st ed. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates; 2002.

The most common initial symptom is back pain, followed by development of a myelopathic syndrome as the hematoma compresses the cord. It is more common in males, and more frequent in the thoracolumbar region. Major risk factors for spinal epidural hematoma include anticoagulation either from medications or from coagulopathies, and thrombocytopenia. Other 917 factors that may increase the risk of this condition are trauma, neoplasms, pregnancy, and vascular malformations. Dural arteriovenous fistula is the most common vascular malformation of the spinal cord, and presents with an insidious and slowly progressive myelopathic syndrome, sometimes with acute exacerbations. These manifestations are caused by increased venous congestion and mass effect in the spinal cord, leading to venous infarcts. Acute hemorrhages may occur, however dural arteriovenous fistulas rarely produce epidural hematomas. The MRI of the spine may show cord signal abnormalities and flow voids, but the definitive diagnostic procedure is conventional angiography. Atherosclerosis, aortic dissection, and aortic manipulation (especially above the renal arteries) are associated with ischemic infarcts of the spinal cord. Prolonged hypotension may be associated with watershed infarcts of the spinal cord. Hypotension, atherosclerosis, and aortic manipulation are not typically associated with spinal epidural hematomas.

      "explicacao": "The majority of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases are sporadic. Familial ALS is usually autosomal dominant in inheritance, although autosomal recessive forms occur and X-linked inheritance is rare. The cause of ALS is unknown; there are various hypotheses, and several environmental exposures postulated and investigated as causative but without definite evidence of associations. The majority of ALS cases are sporadic; approximately 10% are familial. Several gene mutations or deletions have now been identified, resulting in differing patterns of inheritance (most frequently autosomal dominant, but also autosomal recessive and 918 rarely X-linked), age of onset, and phenotypic variability. Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene on chromosome 21 account for approximately 20% of cases of familial ALS and less than 5% of sporadic ALS cases. The abnormal SOD1 protein usually maintains its dismutase function but appears to damage motor neurons through other mechanisms, including a toxic gain of function of the mutant protein. Over 160 mutations have been identified, most often inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. A rare form of ALS associated with parkinsonism and frontotemporal dementia was identified in a geographically restricted area in the Western Pacific island of Guam. Several theories abound regarding this rare syndrome, including exposure to cyanobacterial toxins and the presence of specific genetic mutations in the indigenous population.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "The patient’s history and MRI shown in Figure 11.3 are consistent with a cervical spondylotic myelopathy with spinal cord compression, which has occurred slowly over months. This condition is the most common cause of spinal cord compression in the elderly. Spondylosis is a degeneration of the spinal column, in which there is formation of osteophytes which eventually lead to compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots. Along with this, there are also disc herniations and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, leading to narrowing of the spinal canal. Since the degenerative process progresses slowly, the neurologic manifestations develop insidiously, unlike acute cord compressions in which the patient will have manifestations of spinal shock, which include weakness below the level of the lesion with flaccidity and hyporeflexia, sensory loss, and sphincteric dysfunction. Patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy will gradually develop neck stiffness and pain, weakness at and below the compression level, and unsteady gait. The examination shows findings of upper motor neuron signs below the level of 919 compression, with spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, and upgoing toes. In the upper extremities there may be evidence of lower motor neuron signs such as areflexia and atrophy, mainly at the same level of the compression. Patients have sensory deficits and may experience L’hermitte’s phenomenon, an electric sensation radiating down the back that occurs following neck flexion. The diagnostic test of choice is MRI of the spine. Goals of treatment include prevention of further neurologic deficits and therapies to help improve existing ones. Surgical decompression is the treatment of choice. Nonoperative options may provide pain relief, however once myelopathic findings are evident, this therapeutic option may not alter the course of the disease. Radiation therapy plays no role in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, and is reserved for the treatment of radiosensitive neoplasms. Steroid therapy is not indicated, and is mainly used in patients with traumatic spinal injury, and in some cases of neoplastic cord compression. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP.

      "explicacao": "This patient has had radiation to the spine with development of radiation-induced myelopathy. There are two types of radiation- induced myelopathy, a transient and a delayed form. The transient form happens early, approximately 3 to 6 months after the radiation treatment, and presents with dysesthesias in the extremities which eventually resolve without sequelae. The delayed form occurs 6 months or greater following radiation therapy, as in this case. The presentation is insidious with paresthesias and dysesthesias of the feet, Lhermitte’s phenomenon, and progressive weakness of the legs. Eventually, bowel and bladder can be affected. The MRI shows increased T2 signal in the affected regions, sometimes with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement. Steroids have been tried, however, the key is prevention by minimizing the dose of radiation used. Lathyrism is a neurotoxic disorder presenting as a myelopathy 920 with subacute spastic paraparesis. It is endemic in certain parts of Ethiopia, India, and Bangladesh, and occurs from the consumption of Lathyrus sativus, a legume (grass pea or chick pea) which contains the toxin beta-N-oxalylamino-L-alanine. It is more prevalent in poor populations. Konzo is a type of myelopathy that presents with a spastic paraparesis of abrupt onset, sometimes associated with involvement of the visual pathways. It is most commonly seen in certain parts of Africa and results from consumption of poorly processed cassava which contains cyanide. It is more prevalent in droughts and in poor populations. Epidural lipomatosis is a condition in which there is hypertrophy of extramedullary adipose tissue in the epidural space, and is usually associated with chronic use of steroids. Patients present with back pain and myelopathic findings. The treatment involves stopping steroids, and sometimes even surgical decompression. MRI of the spine demonstrates the fatty tissue within the spinal canal producing spinal stenosis, which was not described in this patient. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

It causes an illness characterized by meningitis, encephalitis, and myeloradiculitis. Cases in the USA present during summer months, and the initial symptom is fever, progressing to altered mental status, GI 922 symptoms, back pain, and flaccid weakness with areflexia, more often proximal and asymmetric and sometimes affecting four limbs. The progression to nadir occurs in 3 to 8 days. The diagnosis is made with serology, CSF antibodies, and/or PCR. The CSF shows neutrophilic pleocytosis with high protein and normal glucose. The MRI shows cauda equina, spinal cord, and/or leptomeningeal enhancement. Pathologic studies have shown perivascular inflammation with anterior horn cell loss in the spinal cord. Many enteroviruses and herpesviruses are associated with a transverse myelitis, usually as a postinfectious phenomenon; there are no features of transverse myelitis in this case. Poliovirus is an enterovirus which can lead to areflexic flaccid paralysis from damage to anterior horn cells, however, poliovirus does not commonly cause the encephalopathic changes seen in WNV, and furthermore it has been eradicated from the United States. This patient does not have history to suggest HIV, which causes a gradually progressive myelopathy characterized by spastic paraparesis with impaired vibration and proprioception sensation, and sensory gait ataxia. The pathologic finding on HIV myelopathy is microvacuolar changes. Myelopathy from HIV is usually a late disease manifestation, and does not seem to be the case in this patient. HTLV-1 is a virus transmitted via sexual, parenteral or maternal routes, which causes a chronic progressive myelopathy known as tropical spastic paraparesis. The myelopathy is usually localized in the thoracic region and pathologically there is neuronal cell loss, microvacuolization, and long tract degeneration. The diagnosis is made by detecting antibodies to HTLV-1 in the serum and CSF, as well as PCR amplification of the DNA of the virus. This virus is also associated with adult T-cell lymphoma and leukemia. HTLV-2 is also associated with a progressive myelopathy and can be seen in native Americans, IV drug users, and patients with HIV, but this is much less common than HTLV-1.

      "explicacao": "This patient has neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or Devic’s disease, which is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system affecting the optic nerves and the spinal cord. It is nine times more common in women than in men, and unlike multiple sclerosis, tends to affect more Asian and African populations. Patients will present with a combination of optic neuritis and myelitis. The myelitis usually presents acutely as a longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis expanding usually over three or more segments. This commonly causes bilateral signs and symptoms which can be severe. The MRI of the spinal cord demonstrates T2 hyperintensity and gadolinium enhancement. Brain MRI may show white matter changes, however, these changes are nonspecific, and nondiagnostic for MS. There are sometimes unusual brain changes in areas where aquaporin channels are common such as in the brainstem and hypothalamus. Occasionally, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) changes may be present. CSF is frequently abnormal, showing increased WBCs, and increased protein with normal glucose. Oligoclonal bands are rarely present in the CSF, in contrast to multiple sclerosis. Pathologic analysis of the spinal cord tissue will show inflammation and demyelination, with polymorphonuclear infiltrates and eosinophils, associated with necrosis. The NMO-IgG antibody helps to make the diagnosis and is part of the diagnostic criteria. It has a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 99%. This antibody is directed against Aquaporin-4 which is a protein located on astrocyte foot processes around cerebral microvessels located at the blood–brain barrier, and functions as a water channel. Aquaporin-4 is not present in neurons. A majority of patients will have nonspecific seropositivity to other autoantibodies, including the antinuclear antibody (ANA). The presence of these antibodies does not establish the presence of other autoimmune disease nor does it establish causality. It is 924 possible that these seropositivities are a result of a general predisposition to autoimmunity. Jarius S, Paul F, Franciotta D, et al.

This is a peroxisomal disorder transmitted in an X-linked fashion and associated with a mutation in the ABCD1 gene on chromosome Xq28 which encodes a peroxisomal adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter protein. Because of this mutation there is an impaired ability to oxidize very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), especially hexacosanoic acid, leading to the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues and plasma. In adrenoleukodystrophy there are four main phenotypes; an early onset cerebral white matter disease (adrenoleukodystrophy), adrenomyeloneuropathy, isolated Addison’s disease, or asymptomatic. In adrenomyeloneuropathy male patients begin having manifestations around age 20, with slowly progressive paraparesis, sensory neuropathy, problems with sphincter control, mild hypogonadism, and mild cognitive impairment. Some patients may develop hearing and visual impairment as well. Most patients also develop adrenal insufficiency. Increased levels of VLCFA in plasma and cultured fibroblasts help in the diagnosis. Patients require steroids for the adrenal insufficiency, however, this medication does not have an effect on the CNS involvement. Very early bone marrow transplantation may be a therapeutic option. Neither amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP), nor neuromyelitis optica (NMO) lead to adrenal insufficiency or the 925 cognitive, behavioral, or sensory features that the patient in this case has.

      "explicacao": "This patient has a dissociated sensory loss with loss of sensation to pain and temperature and preserved sensation to tactile touch, vibration, and proprioception in his upper extremities. This clinical syndrome is seen with central spinal cord lesions in which there is compromise of the crossing fibers in the midline anterior to the central canal, which carry the sensory input related to pain and temperature. Usually the distribution of this sensory loss is described as a “cape-like” or “shawl-like” distribution. Since it does not affect the posterior columns, the sensory modalities carried by this pathway are not affected. This dissociated sensory loss is seen in syringomyelia, in which there is a cavitation in the central parts of the spinal cord, usually in the cervical region, sometimes extending upward to the brainstem or downward to the thoracic region. It has been described that patients with syringomyelia, given their lack of sensory input in their upper extremities, may experience repeated trauma and recurrent injuries. Syringomyelia may be associated with other developmental anomalies of the vertebral column or skull, as well as with Chiari malformations. This patient does not have a spinal cord infarct, since the history is that of a gradually progressive illness, and there is no significant motor disturbance, such as that seen from infarcts affecting the anterior horns and corticospinal tracts. Brown-Séquard syndrome, or hemisection of the spinal cord is a characteristic syndrome in which there is loss of pain and temperature sensation contralateral to the side of the lesion due to interruption of the crossed spinothalamic tract. There is also ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sensation below the level of the lesion from interruption of the ipsilateral posterior columns, as well as ipsilateral weakness below the lesion from corticospinal tract involvement. The presentation is not consistent with subacute combined 926 degeneration of the spinal cord, which affects posterior columns and subsequently anterolateral columns, and is characterized by dysesthesias, alteration in proprioception and vibration, and spastic paraparesis.

Primary neoplasms accounting for intramedullary spinal cord metastases include small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cell cancer, lymphoma, and melanoma. However, metastatic intramedullary disease is not very common, and primary intramedullary tumors are more frequent. Meningioma is a common intradural extramedullary tumor, which has predilection for the thoracic spine, and with its growth can produce spinal cord compression. Nerve sheath tumors such as schwannomas and neurofibromas are also intradural and extramedullary. The most frequent intradural intramedullary tumors found include ependymoma and astrocytoma. Astrocytomas are the most common in children, and are usually slow-growing low-grade tumors. Ependymomas are the most common spinal cord tumors in adults, usually arising from the central canal and expanding outward.

At the time of presentation, the illness was apparently monophasic, with symmetric involvement of the brain white matter and simultaneous spinal cord involvement. CSF findings support an inflammatory cause. In this case the most likely explanation for her clinical picture is an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). ADEM is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of childhood in which there is a monophasic immunologic reaction to a viral illness. Patients will have an encephalopathy, with confluent white matter changes on MRI and inflammatory markers in the CSF. Occasionally, the spinal cord is also affected with features of a transverse myelitis, in which the lesion affects more than three segments of the spinal cord. The treatment is intravenous steroids in high doses. Encephalopathy is not a feature of neuromyelitis optica; the patient may have some white matter lesions but in contrast to ADEM, they are not symmetric or confluent. Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder which presents with a relapsing and remitting or a progressive course. When it affects the spinal cord the lesions are usually in short segments, not like in this case. Acute encephalopathy is not common in MS. The diagnosis of idiopathic transverse myelitis is made when the patient has a transverse myelitis with no other explanation, and usually without other features.

This patient has a lesion above T1, and will likely have a Horner’s syndrome. As shown in Figure 11.4 , this patient has an intramedullary lesion producing signal abnormality in the cervical cord from C1 to C6. Since the lesion has developed gradually, the patient will likely have myelopathic findings with upper motor neuron manifestations below the lesion. Therefore, the patient will likely have increased tone with spasticity and hyperreflexia below the level of the lesion. Some cases will demonstrate lower motor neuron findings at the same level of the lesion due to involvement of anterior horn cells, in this case probably in the upper extremities. A sensory level is helpful for clinical localization of the level of the lesion. The level of the nipple line correlates with T4. Other levels that are useful landmarks are the base of the neck (C4), the umbilicus (T10), the groin (L1), and the anal region (S5). In this case the lesion is in the cervical region, therefore the patient’s sensory level is likely above the nipple line.

      "explicacao": "The ligaments between the atlas and the axis, as well as the odontoid process are important in maintaining the stability of this articulation. When this articulation fails, or the odontoid is absent 929 or damaged, atlantoaxial dislocation can occur, leading to neck pain, and other manifestations of spinal cord compression including quadriplegia and death. Rheumatoid arthritis is known to produce a destructive inflammatory process of the ligaments attaching the odontoid process to the atlas and the skull, therefore causing atlantoaxial dislocation. Other causes of atlantoaxial dislocation include Klippel–Feil syndrome, Down’s syndrome, and Morquio syndrome. Klippel–Feil syndrome is a decreased number and abnormal fusion of cervical vertebrae. Morquio syndrome is a skeletal disease in which the odontoid process may be aplastic or absent, leading to secondary spinal cord disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus has been associated with syndromes consistent with myelitis or myelopathy, but not related to atlantoaxial dislocation. Piña-Garza JE.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Neoplastic disease of the spinal cord can be intrinsic to the cord or metastatic disease. Tumors affecting the spinal column and spinal cord can be anatomically divided into extradural or intradural, the latter further classified into intramedullary or extramedullary. All of these tumors can also be divided into metastatic or nonmetastatic disease. The most common nonmetastatic extramedullary tumors include neurofibromas, schwannomas, and meningiomas. The most frequent nonmetastatic intramedullary tumors are spinal cord astrocytomas and ependymomas. Metastatic disease to the spine most commonly originates from breast, lung, prostate, and kidney cancer, although it is not limited to these. Other invading neoplastic lesions include lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Spinal cord neoplastic diseases usually present with pain and 930 focal neurologic manifestations resulting from spinal cord compression or dysfunction. Patients will have findings consistent with myelopathy, along with other manifestations of the underlying cancer. The diagnostic test of choice to determine the presence of neoplastic disease is MRI of the spinal cord with gadolinium. There are multiple treatment options that are selected depending on the underlying neoplasm, degree of neurologic disease, timing of presentation, functional status, and prognosis. Steroids are frequently used, especially in the acute phase of cord compression, with dexamethasone being the most commonly used. Methylprednisolone with a 30 mg/kg bolus and an infusion of 5.4 mg/kg/h for 23 hours is a formulation used more commonly in spinal cord traumatic injury, but not for neoplastic disease. Radiation therapy is used for radiosensitive neoplasias, such as lymphoproliferative disease and germ cell tumors, and for various types of metastases, particularly in the setting of cord compression. It may be used as a palliative measure to improve symptoms of pain and other symptoms of cord compression. Surgical resection should be entertained when feasible, even in cases of metastatic disease, where it has shown superiority when combined with radiotherapy as compared to radiotherapy alone. However surgical treatments may not be possible in some neoplasms such as in intramedullary lesions. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

      "explicacao": "Spinal cord trauma is a significant cause of myelopathy and common cause of severe disability after trauma, especially in young adults. Trauma will produce spinal cord injury by multiple 931 mechanisms, including direct transection of the cord, displacement of spinal column structures, disruption of axons, interruption of blood flow to the cord, hemorrhage, inflammation, and/or edema. After spinal cord injury there are two phases: an initial phase of spinal shock followed by a second phase of increased reflex activity with spasticity. The acute spinal shock phase occurs soon after the injury, and lasts for a few weeks (between 1 and 6, but with no exact limits). It is manifested by suppression of spinal segmental activity below the level of the lesion. With complete spinal cord injury, the patient will have a flaccid weakness with areflexia below the lesion, atonic bladder with overflow incontinence, distention of the bowel with absence of peristalsis and constipation, depressed rectal tone and abolished genital reflexes. There is autonomic dysfunction below the lesion explaining the hypotension seen in these cases. A few weeks after the spinal cord injury, the patient will start presenting features of increased reflexic activity below the lesion. There is no clear chronologic boundary between this stage and the previous one of spinal shock. In this second stage there are upper motor neuron findings with increased tone leading to spasticity and hyperreflexia. Plantar responses are upgoing, triple flexion response commonly occurs. Patients will have detrusor spasms and hyperactivity with urinary loss secondary to spontaneous bladder contraction as well as spontaneous reflex defecation. These bladder and bowel reflexes are probably explained by the lack of inhibition of the sacral neurons by rostral centers, leading to spontaneous contraction secondary to a local reflex arc. Neither spontaneous reflex defecation nor detrusor contraction is present in the spinal shock phase. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP. Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology. 10th ed.

      "explicacao": "Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, and is associated with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations. Myelopathy is frequently encountered and can be produced by various mechanisms, including spinal cord infarction. Tabes dorsalis is the classic myelopathic syndrome described in neurosyphilis, and is characterized by dysfunction of the posterior columns with prominent sensory ataxia and proprioceptive loss, along with other manifestations such as sphincter dysfunction, Lhermitte’s sign, lancinating pain, and areflexia. The natural history of tabes dorsalis has been described in three different phases: 1. A preataxic phase in which the patient has lancinating pain of his legs, along with sphincter and sexual dysfunction. 2. The ataxic phase with prominent proprioceptive loss, sensory ataxia leading to the development of Charcot joints. 3. A postataxic or paralytic phase characterized by spastic paraparesis, autonomic dysfunction, worsening of the pain and sphincter dysfunction, and cachexia. 933 Pathologic findings demonstrate inflammation, demyelination, and gliosis of the posterior columns and dorsal roots of the spinal cord. Syphilis can also produce spinal cord disease by other mechanisms, such as spinal cord infarction from vasculitis or meningovascular syphilis, meningomyelitis manifested as an inflammatory myelitis, and more unusual and uncommon forms such as hypertrophic pachymeningitis and gummas, which can be intramedullary or extramedullary.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "The conus medullaris is at the lower end of the spinal cord, beyond which the lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots descend within the spinal canal as a bundle of fibers called the cauda equina (cauda equina = horse’s tail) to reach their corresponding exit foramina. Lesions in the lumbar or lumbosacral region can compress either the conus medullaris and/or the cauda equina, producing a distinctive clinical syndrome. A lesion affecting primarily the conus medullaris will present with sensory deficits in a saddle distribution, which is usually bilateral and symmetric. Pain is often symmetric, but is not typically radicular. There is usually lower extremity symmetric weakness and sometimes decreased or absent ankle reflexes, but this may be mild. Bowel and bladder dysfunction occur early in the course of the disease, as well as sexual dysfunction. A lesion that affects the cauda equina presents with distinctive radicular pain with an asymmetric distribution. Motor deficits are also asymmetric with evidence of hyporeflexia. Bowel and bladder function may be affected but usually this occurs later in the course and less frequently than with conus lesions. Spasticity and other upper motor neuron signs will not be present as this is a lower motor neuron disorder. This patient has features of cauda equina syndrome.

      "explicacao": "The diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is made based on the history, examination, and electrophysiologic testing. The El Escorial diagnostic criteria for definite ALS as defined by the World Federation of Neurology include clinical and/or electrophysiologic evidence of both upper and lower motor neuron involvement in at least three of the four following regions: bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral. Electrodiagnostic features of ALS include evidence of ongoing denervation indicated by the presence of spontaneous activity (fibrillation potentials) and chronic denervation (reduced recruitment, polyphasic motor units). Other variable features include fasciculation potentials and motor unit instability (variability of amplitude of the motor unit and repetitive discharges). Reduced motor unit recruitment with a rapid firing rate on EMG reflects compensation of existing motor units for those that are no longer functional, and only a single motor unit may be seen to be activated during voluntary contraction in a severely denervated muscle. Sensory NCS are normal. EMG/NCS is indicated in the evaluation of a patient with suspected ALS, and should include evaluation of cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions routinely, and of bulbar region when clinically affected. The differential diagnosis of ALS is broad, and investigations into alternative, especially treatable causes are indicated when there are features suggesting the possibility of another diagnosis. In the 935 evaluation of an ALS patient, laboratory and imaging studies are done as indicated to exclude mimickers of ALS. There are a variety of other disorders that lead to clinical signs and symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron involvement that are on the differential diagnosis of ALS including Machado–Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3), adrenoleukodystrophy, multifocal motor neuropathy, hyperparathyroidism, cervical spondylosis, GM2 gangliosidoses, polyglucosan body disease, paraneoplastic motor neuron disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- associated motor neuron disease, West Nile virus infection, and others. Laboratory tests may include evaluation of parathyroid hormone, paraneoplastic autoantibodies (such as anti-Hu), GM1 autoantibodies, and others depending on the suspicion. MRI of the brain and spinal cord are indicated to exclude other potential causes masquerading clinically as ALS such as cervical spondylosis. MRI in ALS may show increased signal in the corticospinal tract on T2-, proton density-, and FLAIR-weighted images, possibly due to wallerian degeneration. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "Copper is a trace element that functions as a prosthetic group in metalloenzymes that have a role in maintaining the structure and function of the central nervous system. Copper deficiency causes a myelopathy similar to that seen in B12 deficiency. It also produces multiple other neurologic manifestations, including peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system demyelination, myopathy, and optic neuropathy. Hematologic manifestations are also seen in copper deficiency, with anemia, neutropenia, and left shift in granulocytic and erythroid maturation. MRI of the spine may show T2-signal hyperintensity in the paramedian cord, most frequently in the cervical level. Copper deficiency results from malabsorption, one of the most common causes being previous gastric surgery, especially bariatric surgery for weight loss. It is frequent to find vitamin B12 deficiency along with copper deficiency, and in most cases in 936 clinical practice, B12 is supplemented while copper is usually overlooked. Lack of improvement with vitamin B12 supplementation should prompt evaluation for copper deficiency. Excessive zinc ingestion may also contribute to copper deficiency, since zinc induces the synthesis of metallothionein in enterocytes, which has a high affinity to copper, leading to internalization of copper into the enterocytes and its eventual loss when they are sloughed off in the mucosa.

Two pedicles arise from the posterior aspect of each vertebral body, and then fuse posteriorly through two laminae, leaving the spinal canal in the middle within which the spinal cord lies. Multiple ligaments attach and give support to the vertebral column. The anterior longitudinal ligament runs along the anterior surface of the vertebral bodies, whereas the posterior longitudinal ligament runs in the posterior surface, and ventral to the spinal cord. The ligamentum flavum runs in the posterior aspect of the spinal canal, and the denticulate ligament extends on both sides of the spinal cord between the pia mater and the dura mater. Between each vertebral body there is an intervertebral disc, which is composed of a central nucleus pulposus and a surrounding annulus fibrosus. The spinal cord has 31 segments and a corresponding number of pairs of spinal nerve roots, with 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal. The cervical nerve roots exit the spinal column above the vertebral body of the same number, except for C8, which exit between the C7-T1 intervertebral foramen. The subsequent nerve roots below this level will exit the spinal column below the corresponding vertebral body. In adults, the spinal cord extends from the foramen magnum to the level of L1-L2.

SMA type 1, infantile SMA or Werdnig–Hoffman disease presents with decreased fetal movements, neonatal hypotonia, and weak cry. Patients with SMA type 1 exhibit head lag and frog-leg posture when supine, and are never able to sit up or achieve antigravity strength in the arms or legs. Diffuse areflexia is often present. Bulbar involvement leads to dysphagia, and respiratory involvement occurs. Death usually occurs by 2 years of age. In SMA type 2, intermediate SMA, symptoms begin in the first 1 to 2 years of life, with motor delay and tremor in some cases. This form is less severe than SMA1, with most children being able to sit unsupported, but significant contractures develop, and most are not able to ambulate. SMA type 3, juvenile SMA or Kugelberg–Welander disease, typically presents in childhood (between ages 5 and 15 years) with difficult walking. The clinical picture is one of proximal muscle weakness, a fine action tremor, and fasciculations. Patients often remain ambulatory into adulthood. SMA type 4, adult-onset SMA or pseudomyopathic SMA, is the least common and least severe. Symptoms typically begin in the third to fourth decade of life, and include proximal muscle weakness, with the quadriceps being prominently involved, and fasciculations. Ambulation into late adulthood is common. Cranial nerve and respiratory involvement is rare. Commercially available molecular analysis of the SMN gene is available. Serum creatine kinase may be significantly elevated (more than 10 times normal), particularly in the younger-onset forms. Sensory NCSs are normal; EMG shows evidence of acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation, with large polyphasic motor units. Complex repetitive discharges occur in SMA type 3. Muscle biopsy shows atrophy of entire fascicles or groups of fascicles, with normal or hypertrophied neighboring fascicles, as depicted in Figure 11.5 . The majority of cases of SMA are due to mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene on chromosome 5. Inheritance is autosomal recessive in most cases, though a minority of cases involving other genes with autosomal dominant or X- 939 linked inheritance have been identified. The gene product, SMN1 protein, is involved in RNA processing. In later-onset forms, some residual functional protein is present, leading to the milder phenotype. As mentioned, spinal muscular atrophy type 4 presents in adulthood. Charcot–Marie–Tooth type 1 typically presents in childhood (rather than the neonatal period), and will not be associated with the muscle biopsy findings shown in Figure 11.5 .

The manifestations occur in patients with underlying cobalamin deficiency even after a single exposure to nitrous oxide, usually with a rapid onset of symptoms. However, chronic exposure can lead to similar manifestations, and this has been described among anesthetists, dentists, or medical personnel working with nitrous oxide, either from occupational exposure or from abuse. Patients with chronic exposure can have an acute exacerbation during an acute exposure to larger amounts of nitrous oxide. The neurologic manifestations include myelopathy, neuropathy or even cognitive changes, and encephalopathy. MRI changes with T2 hyperintensity can be detected. Prophylactic vitamin B12 can help prevent this condition. This patient does not have copper deficiency, which usually produces a more protracted course, usually related to malabsorption. In cases of malabsorption after gastric bypass, the 940 manifestations usually occur gradually over months or years. Folate deficiency causes neurologic manifestations in very rare instances, and usually gradually over long periods of time in patients who have other nutrient deficiencies. In cases of spinal epidural abscess or hematomas causing myelopathy, the MRI images usually are distinct, showing spinal cord compression, which is not the case in this patient.

This condition presents in young patients of Asian origin, and it is characterized by progressive asymmetric wasting of one or both hands and forearms. Examination shows atrophy and fasciculations with no sensory deficits. These patients have a high incidence of atopic disorders. The pathophysiology is not understood, but some have suggested a chronic progressive compression of the cervical cord, associated with dynamic changes of the cervical dural sac and spinal cord induced by neck flexion. The MRI of the cervical spine in flexion demonstrates cervical cord thinning with signal changes. A cervical collar may be used to prevent neck flexion, and surgical intervention may have an impact in some patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease in which there are upper and lower motor neuron signs in multiple segments of the neuraxis. This patient has only lower motor neuron findings in his upper extremities, which is usually not consistent with ALS. Primary lateral sclerosis is a disorder in which the predominant feature is the presence of upper motor neuron signs, without lower motor neuron signs, which is not consistent with the case 941 presented. Spinal muscular atrophy is a group of genetic disorders that affect the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and motor nuclei of the brainstem. Usually there are findings affecting upper and lower limbs, as well as bulbar muscles. Spinal muscular atrophy is discussed in question 35.

The spinal cord’s blood supply consists of one anterior spinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries. The former supplies the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, whereas the two posterior spinal arteries supply the posterior third. Therefore patients with an anterior spinal artery syndrome will present with weakness below the lesion, with sensory deficit to pain and temperature due to involvement of the lateral spinothalamic tracts, but because the dorsal columns are not involved, there is preservation of vibratory sense and proprioception. Spinal cord infarction may occur after aortic aneurysm surgical repair. Endovascular approaches have a lower rate of overall complications as compared to open surgical approaches, including lower rates of spinal cord ischemia, however, this can still occur. In this case there is no history or clinical findings to support a spinal epidural hematoma as the cause. Patients with copper and vitamin B12 deficiency usually present rather gradually and not rapidly as in this case. Furthermore, vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with posterior column degeneration affecting 942 proprioception and vibratory sensation, which was not present in this case.

Although imprecise, MCI is characterized by cognitive complaints (especially when noticed by friends and family), objective cognitive impairment for age and education, intact activities of daily living, and preserved general cognition. Impairments may be in one or more cognitive domains such as attention, memory, language, executive, or visuospatial function. In general, MCI is classified as amnestic MCI (primarily memory), nonamnestic MCI (cognitive domain other than memory, such as language), or multiple domain MCI (more than one cognitive domains are affected). A gradual decline in cognition can be characteristic of normal aging, but it can often be differentiated from MCI by the degree of cognitive impairment. Amnestic MCI is often an early stage of Alzheimer’s disease, with a conversion rate to dementia of about 10% to 15% per year. Petersen RC, Smith GE, Waring SC, et al.

      "explicacao": "980 According to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines, routine dementia screening should include assessment for vitamin B12, complete blood count, electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and depression screening. Further testing including HIV, VDRL, lumbar puncture, and heavy metals are not recommended in routine screening without a specific clinical indication. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Inherited forms of AD are all autosomal dominant and typically present before age 65, although these cases account for less than 5% of all cases of AD. Presenilin-2 in chromosome 1 leads to early- onset familial AD. Presenilin-1 in chromosome 14, accounts for 70% to 80% of early-onset aggressive familial cases of AD. Apolipoprotein E4 is located in chromosome 19 and triples the risk of AD as well as leading to an early age of onset, but does not lead to AD per se (it only modifies the risk of AD). Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is located in chromosome 21. Chromosome 2 is not related to AD. In addition, variants in the TREM2 gene appear to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia. Injury to any structures within the circuit of Papez will interrupt formation of new memories. The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus is not part of the circuit of Papez. The circuit of Papez is: entorhinal cortex → hippocampus → fornix → mammillary bodies → anterior nucleus of thalamus → cingulate gyrus → entorhinal cortex → hippocampus. Memory is conceptually divided into different forms. Immediate memory is the amount of information someone can keep in conscious awareness without active memorization. Immediate memory can be tested by forward digit span. Normal human beings can retain seven digits in active memory span. Working memory is tested by manipulation of information retained in immediate memory (adding two of the digits repeated in a number series, or reciting a series of numbers backward [digits backward]). Recent memory involves the ability to register and recall specific items after a delay of minutes or hours. It requires the hippocampus and parahippocampal areas of the medial temporal lobe for storage and retrieval, which is why it is usually impaired first in early AD and is evident by impaired 981 word recall (three-word recall). Remote memory is tested by asking about historical life events and long-known information. Memory impairment is the essential and earliest clinical feature of AD. Declarative memory (facts and events) is significantly affected in AD. Of declarative memory, episodic memory (specific events and contexts) is the most impaired in early AD. Within episodic memory, memory for recent events is more prominently impaired in early AD compared with immediate or remote memory. Memory for facts such as vocabulary and concepts (semantic memory) is spared until later. Likewise, procedural memory and motor learning are also spared until later. Loss of visuospatial skills is also often an early feature of AD which manifests as navigational difficulty in unfamiliar and later familiar areas and misplacement of items. Other features often associated with later stages of AD include progressive language dysfunction, impaired executive function, lack of insight, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and apraxia. Inability to recognize objects and faces, or visual agnosia and prosopagnosia, respectively (see discussion to question 48) are late features. Ahmed S, Mitchell J, Arnold R, et al.

FDG-PET scanning in Parkinson’s disease usually does not show a decrease in metabolism. All of the listed items in question 8 are commonly associated histopathologic findings seen in AD. Amyloid deposition appears to be an early feature of AD. Amyloid imaging in patients with genetic forms of AD show amyloid deposition in the brain years before clinical symptoms occur. Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the most specific, although granulovacuolar degeneration, amyloid deposition, and Hirano bodies are also commonly seen. Cortical Lewy bodies are classically found primarily in dementia with Lewy bodies, although there are occasionally overlapping histopathologic features between different types of dementia. Alzheimer’s type II astrocytes are seen in hepatic encephalopathy, not in AD. In AD, along with loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, there is loss of acetyltransferase activity throughout the cortex which correlates with the severity of memory loss. The locus coeruleus contains noradrenergic neurons, the median and dorsal raphe nuclei contain serotonergic neurons, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area contain dopaminergic neurons, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata contain GABAergic neurons (as opposed to the pars compacta which contain dopaminergic neurons).

Auditory hallucinations, hyperphagia, and aphasia are not typical findings in DLB, though they may occur in atypical cases or in advanced disease. DLB is considered the second most common type of degenerative dementia after Alzheimer disease. In addition to dementia, other clinical features may include dysautonomia, REM sleep behavior disorder, and neuroleptic sensitivity. Treatment is generally symptomatic and targeted toward specific disease manifestations. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be of benefit. Levodopa may worsen hallucinations and high doses should be avoided in DLB. Neuroleptics have been associated with increased risk of mortality when used in older adults with dementia, but in some cases, putative benefits outweigh risks of use. Typical neuroleptics are generally avoided due to significant sensitivity, with reactions such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, worsening parkinsonism, confusion, or autonomic dysfunction. If absolutely necessary, especially for agitated psychotic symptoms, atypical neuroleptics should be tried cautiously in low doses. Of the choices in question 11, quetiapine is the only atypical antipsychotic. Clozapine might be used as well, but the risk of neutropenia and complexity of use and follow-up make it less desirable.

      "explicacao": "In familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the most common linkage is to chromosome 17q21, although chromosomes 3 and 9 have also been implicated in autosomal dominant inheritance of this condition. Most sporadic cases of frontotemporal dementia have not been linked to specific chromosomal sites. The remaining chromosomes listed in this question have been implicated in familial Alzheimer’s disease. In FTD, mean age of symptom onset is between 55 and 60 years. There are three major distinct clinical phenotypes of FTD. The behavioral variant FTD is the most common phenotype and symptoms include personality change, abulia, apathy, social withdrawal, social disinhibition, impulsivity, lack of insight, poor 986 personal hygiene, stereotyped or ritual behaviors, hyperphagia, suddenly new artistic abilities or hobbies, emotional blunting, loss of empathy, mental rigidity, distractibility, impersistence, perseverative behavior, impaired organizational and executive skills. The patient depicted in question 14 appears to have this phenotype. The second phenotype, progressive nonfluent aphasia, is characterized in early stages by anomia, word-finding difficulty, impaired object naming, and effortful speech with preserved comprehension. Spontaneous speech becomes increasingly dysfluent and speech errors become frequent. Behavior and social interaction remain unaffected until late in the disease at which point the patient becomes globally aphasic. The third phenotype is semantic dementia, also called progressive fluent aphasia, or the temporal variant of FTD. It is characterized by a progressive speech disturbance with normal fluency, but impaired comprehension, anomia, and semantic paraphasias. It may clinically resemble a transcortical sensory aphasia. There is typically a predominance of left temporal dysfunction, and/or in face and object recognition, reflecting right temporal dysfunction. In addition, some patients with FTD may develop variant syndromes of motor impairment including motor neuron disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. REM sleep behavioral disorder typically occurs in individuals with synucleinopathies, rather than in tauopathies such as FTD. Josephs KA. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

Recall the vascular distribution and the homunculus in which the legs are supplied by the ACA, where they are represented along the medial sagittal cortical surface. Pontine infarcts can result in leg weakness and incontinence but not frontal lobe symptoms. Other neurologic deficits including cranial nerve dysfunction would be expected with a pontine infarct. Lesions in the dominant temporal lobe could cause amnesia for verbal information and Wernicke’s aphasia. Lesions in the nondominant temporal lobe can cause amnesia for nonverbal and visuospatial information, as well as amusia. Other etiologies of the symptoms described are discussed in question 19.

Of these, alterations in personality usually interfere with rehabilitation the most. The other listed options frequently result from TBI and may affect rehabilitation but to a lesser degree. In addition, TBI can cause overlapping cognitive, physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms. TBI is the result of a traumatic external force to the skull, injuring the brain.

It is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children and young adults since they are more likely to be involved in these scenarios.

This disorder is further discussed in questions 10 and 11. FDG-PET imaging of DLB reveals bilateral occipital hypometabolism greater than temporoparietal hypometabolism. Progressive supranuclear palsy is associated with global metabolic reduction in regions including the anterior cingulate, basal ganglia (especially caudate and putamen), thalamus, and upper brainstem. In frontotemporal dementia, there is frontotemporal hypometabolism. In Alzheimer’s disease, there is temporoparietal hypometabolism. FDG-PET scan is not typically useful in CJD; specific MRI findings are characteristic, making MRI a useful imaging modality in the diagnosis of CJD. The histopathologic specimen obtained from the brain of this patient shows Lewy bodies, which are seen in DLB. Lewy bodies are cytoplasmic inclusions with anti-ubiquitin and anti-α-synuclein immunohistochemistry. Pick’s disease is defined pathologically by the presence of silver-staining, spherical aggregations of tau protein in neurons (Pick bodies). Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by globose neurofibrillary tangles in subcortical nuclei and tufted astrocytes.

The other listed drugs in question 28 are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Tacrine is no longer available in United States due to hepatotoxicity. Patients with AD have reduced cerebral production of choline acetyl transferase, which leads to a decrease in acetylcholine synthesis and impaired cortical cholinergic function.

Rivastigmine is a combined acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase antagonist, both of 993 which result in limiting the breakdown of acetylcholine. Galantamine is a combined acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric nicotinic modulator.

      "explicacao": "The case presented in question 34 fits the typical clinical scenario 994 of delirium, and checking the patient’s medication list and recent laboratory testing would be the first and probably most useful step in the evaluation of this patient. Delirium is classically differentiated by dementia by its subacute nature (days) and waxing and waning course as opposed to the slow (months to years) steady cognitive impairment seen in dementia. The patient’s age, combined with the stress of major surgery and probable exposure to postoperative pain medications are all contributors to this common occurrence. Infections such as urinary tract infection and pneumonia, as well as hypoxia (such as from pulmonary embolus), are also potential causes of delirium. Assessing his medications to look for contributors (especially narcotics, sedative hypnotics, antihistamines, and anticholinergics) and routine metabolic studies should be checked. An arterial blood gas should be checked if hypoxia is suspected. Visual hallucinations are most often related to metabolic derangements and medications. Although stroke should be ruled out in the appropriate clinical context, it is unlikely in this case based on this constellation of symptoms (especially positive visual hallucinations in the absence of focal findings). Seizures are also unlikely, although occipital lobe seizures can cause colorful geometric hallucinations. In this patient, an EEG would most likely show diffuse slowing, which would be typical of delirium. In this case, his symptoms are unlikely to be related to schizophrenia, as there is no prior history. In addition, hallucinations in schizophrenia are typically auditory, rather than visual. Therefore, there is no need for a psychiatry consult at this time. A lumbar puncture is not indicated given the history presented, though should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.

      "explicacao": "996 This histopathology is consistent with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). The five human prion diseases are kuru, CJD, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) (“mad cow disease”), Gerstmann–Straüssler–Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). These diseases share the neuropathologic features of neuronal loss, glial cell proliferation, absent inflammatory response, and vacuolization of the neuropil, which produces the characteristic spongiform appearance. Sporadic CJD occurs at a rate of approximately 1 per 1,000,000 population per year. CJD is a rapidly progressive dementia associated with variable extrapyramidal/pyramidal tract signs, myoclonus, and ataxia, and death typically ensues within 1 year. Sporadic cases account for 85% to 95%, while 5% to 15% are familial, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The pathology occurs when the normal prion protein (PrP), which is primarily an α-helical structure, converts into an abnormal form containing a higher percentage of β-pleated sheets. The abnormal form is insoluble, polymerizes, and accumulates intracellularly and is resistant to proteolysis. The prion protein gene (PRNP) coding for PrP is located on chromosome 20p. The other chromosomes listed all relate to Alzheimer’s disease. Polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP is believed to determine susceptibility for CJD, and homozygosity for either methionine or valine at codon 129 has a strong correlation with the various forms of CJD including sporadic, iatrogenic, variant (“mad cow disease”), and familial forms. Neuroimaging of CJD includes cortical ribbon sign (restricted diffusion in the cortex), and increased T2 signal in the caudate, putamen, and pulvinar of the thalamus. Hippocampal lumpy bumpy sign is suggestive of Alzheimer’s pathology. Thinning of the head of the caudate may be seen in Huntington’s disease. Calcification in the basal ganglia occurs in Fahr’s disease and in other disorders of calcium metabolism. Eye of the tiger sign is seen pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN).

The major risk factor for AD is aging. Gender has also been associated with increased risk, with female gender conferring a greater risk than male gender. Apolipoprotein E4 genotype is also associated with increased risk of AD. Low level of education, repeated head trauma, family history of dementia, smoking, and vascular risk factors have also been associated with increased risk of AD. AD patients have hypometabolism of the posterior temporal and parietal regions on FDG-PET scan. This was discussed in questions 7–9 and you can review the FDG-PET scan images in Figure 12.1 .

MRI brain would be the first best diagnostic test to start with, and reveals ventriculomegaly, which is out of proportion to cortical atrophy (as seen in Figure 12.8 ). The brain MRI should be obtained prior to lumbar puncture to rule out intracranial masses, atrophy (with resultant ex-vacuo ventriculomegaly), and other pathology. In NPH, there may also be transependymal edema seen on MRI. A large volume lumbar puncture (30 to 50 cc) with subsequent improvement in symptoms predicts a better chance of improvement from a shunting procedure. Therefore, the first step in the treatment of this patient should be a lumbar puncture, possibly followed by shunt procedure (depending on the response to the fluid evacuation with the lumbar puncture). Patients with dementia for more than 2 years are less likely to improve with shunting. 999 Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP. Adams and Victor’s Principles of Neurology. 10th ed.

Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. Ability to recognize people using other cues is often preserved. Face recognition is thought to be a function of the right hemisphere, but prosopagnosia most commonly occurs with bilateral lesions of the 1000 temporo-occipital regions (bilateral fusiform gyri), as occurs with bilateral posterior cerebral artery infarction. It can also be seen as part of more diffuse processes that preferentially affect the temporal lobes, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Associated features may include achromatopsia (a disorder of color perception) and visual field deficits. Topographagnosia, a defect in spatial orientation, is marked by inability to navigate in familiar places, read maps, draw floor maps of familiar places, and perform similar functions. It localizes to the nondominant posterior parahippocampal region, infracalcarine cortex, or nondominant parietal lobe. Asomatognosia is marked by an indifferent inability to recognize one’s own body part. It most often localizes to the contralateral (usually nondominant) superior parietal lobule, the supramarginal gyrus, and/or its connections. In somatoparaphrenia, a form of asomatognosia, the patient denies ownership of a limb or limbs and claims the limb is missing, or has been stolen. Misoplegia is severe hatred of a limb, a rare form of agnosia seen in hemiparetic or hemiplegic patients following stroke. The patient may attempt to cut off the limb or otherwise damage it.

Ability to read individual letters of a word is often retained. Writing and language comprehension are normal in alexia without agraphia. It is a disconnection syndrome, due to lesions in the dominant (usually left) posterior cerebral artery territory, commonly involving the medial and inferior occipitotemporal region and splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient has a contralateral (usually right) homonymous hemianopia. While the ipsilateral visual field is intact, words that are seen cannot be effectively read, as the lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum prevents them from being transmitted to Broca’s area. This is not a disturbance of language per se, unlike Wernicke’s aphasia (discussed in question 53), and is not a neglect syndrome.

      "explicacao": "Pure word deafness, or verbal auditory agnosia, is marked by impaired auditory comprehension of language, though hearing per se (of tones and other nonverbal sounds) is intact; audiogram is normal in these patients. There is normal comprehension of written language, distinguishing it from Wernicke’s (sensory) aphasia; Wernicke’s aphasia is characterized by inability to comprehend, read, or repeat, with fluent, nonsensical speech. The lesion causing 1003 pure word deafness is most often in the bilateral middle portion of the superior temporal gyri, sparing Wernicke’s area, but disrupting its connections with the primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus) and temporal lobe association cortices. Cases have been reported with unilateral dominant hemisphere temporal lobe lesions. This may be associated with amusia, or agnosia for music. In nonverbal auditory agnosia, there is agnosia to sounds, such as the sounds animals make or environmental sounds. This most often occurs with bilateral anterior temporal lesions, though nondominant temporal lobe lesions can lead to this as well. Anomia is inability to name objects with otherwise relative preservation of language expression and comprehension. Patients are able to recognize the objects but cannot name them. Anomia usually occurs in association with other features of Broca’s (expressive) aphasia (see question 54), though it may occur in isolation, particularly during recovery of a Broca’s (expressive) aphasia. Anomia may occur with a variety of lesions, including dominant hemisphere posterior inferior frontal gyrus and temporal lesions. It has also been reported to occur in angular gyrus syndrome, due to lesions of the dominant angular gyrus, in association with Gertsmann’s syndrome (discussed in question 70) and constructional difficulties.

This woman exhibits ideomotor apraxia, which is suggested by use of a body part as an object during pantomime, as well as the unusual movements and postures. Patients with ideomotor apraxia understand the movement that they are supposed to execute, and achieve the general, overall movement, but exhibit abnormal postures and spatial errors. Ideomotor apraxia is seen with lesions in the dominant parietal cortex, in or around the area of the superior marginal and angular gyrus. The dominant feature of conduction apraxia is impairment in imitation of movements. The localization of conduction apraxia is not well defined. Ideational apraxia is characterized by impairment in the sequence of motions needed to carry out a specific movement. When asked to pantomime pouring a glass of water and drinking from it, patients with ideational apraxia will, for example, drink from the cup before pouring water into it. Ideational apraxia is seen in patients with bifrontal or biparietal dysfunction, as occurs in neurodegenerative disorders. Disassociation apraxia is characterized by inability to execute a movement on command, but with normal ability to imitate. It has most commonly been reported to occur in the left hand in left hemispheric language dominant patients who have left MCA territory lesions. Conceptual apraxia is characterized by misconception of the 1008 function of objects in the environment. For example, a patient with conceptual apraxia might use a fork to eat soup, or may pretend to use a screwdriver when asked to pantomime hammering a nail into a wall.

      "explicacao": "The prefrontal cortices (the areas of the frontal lobes anterior to the primary motor cortex) have extensive connections with various cortical and subcortical areas including the limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem. The prefrontal cortex can be functionally divided into orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial areas. Lesions of the frontal lobes, or disruptions in frontal-subcortical pathways, lead to a variety of syndromes that have extensive overlap but can be broadly categorized based on the most prominent features occurring with lesions to the different prefrontal regions. The orbitofrontal cortex is located on the ventral aspect of the frontal lobes. It is involved in judgment, inhibition of socially inappropriate behaviors, as well as emotional and visceral functions. Lesions to this area, which commonly include trauma and olfactory groove or sphenoid wing meningiomas, lead to 1009 changes in personality, social disinhibition, facetiousness, inappropriate jocularity ( witzelsucht ), echopraxia, and utilization behavior (mimicking of use of objects in the environment), as depicted in question 65. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is involved in motor initiation, goal-directed behavior, and motivation. Lesions to this area, and bilateral lesions to the anterior cingulate, which commonly result from anterior cerebral artery infarcts and tumors, lead to apathy, indifference, loss of initiative, amotivation, and abulia, or a reduction (or in severe cases abolition) of movement and communication due to involvement of the supplementary motor area, as depicted in question 66. In extensive bilateral lesions to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the most severe form of this nonparalytic akinesia, akinetic mutism, results. Because the paracentral lobule (the mesial projection of the somatosensory cortex) is involved in voluntary urinary continence, lesions to this area often are associated with urinary incontinence. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in the planning of motor activity and behavior, executive functioning, judgment, and problem solving. Lesions to this area lead to impaired judgment, impaired ability to plan, multitask, and problem solve, and anhedonia, or a lack of interest in previously pleasurable activities, as depicted in question 67.

The patient is timed as he/she places pegs into small grooved holes in a board. The grooves are oriented in different directions, requiring the patient to rotate the peg in their fingers, which increases the demands for distal dexterity. Right and left hands are performed separately, and the patient’s time is compared to normative data. The Trail Making Test Part A times the patient as he/she connects numbers on a page, and is a test of simple speed of processing, visual search, and attention. The Trail Making Test Part B requires the patient to connect consecutive numbers and letters, and tests set shifting (shifting between numbers and letters) and working memory (maintaining the correct sequence), in addition to the demands of Trails A. The Random Cancellation Test, a measure of visual attention and processing speed, assesses the ability to visually scan and identify specific targets in a large array of similar items.

      "explicacao": "The case describes Capgras’ syndrome, which is characterized by the delusional belief that a person, often a member of the patient’s immediate family, is an identical-looking imposter. Other delusional misidentification disorders include Fregoli’s syndrome (in which the patient believes that the same person exists in several disguises), intermetamorphosis (the belief that individuals have swapped identities with each other while maintaining the same external appearance), reduplicative paramnesia (which overlaps significantly with Capgras’, but there is a delusion that there are identical places/objects rather than just 1011 people), and Cotard’s delusion (a person’s belief that they are dead or dying). Pseudocyesis is not classified under the delusional misidentification disorders but is a delusion that a person is pregnant when they are in fact not; the patient may manifest the signs and symptoms of pregnancy. It is more common in females but has been reported in males. Delusional misidentification disorders and other types of delusions can be seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s dementia and Lewy body dementia, as well as in patients with gross structural brain lesions such as traumatic brain injury and cerebral infarction, and these lesions would be usually bifrontal or right hemispheric. The delusional misidentification disorders are also seen in primary psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, affective disorders, and delusional disorder. Devinsky O.

The occurrence of psychotic symptoms in depression is a sign of higher severity of depression and a higher risk of recurrence. In older adults, depression may masquerade as cognitive impairment, what has also been termed “pseudodementia.” Diminished appetite and insomnia are the more common 1061 neurovegetative symptoms in depression. However, with atypical depression, hyperphagia (excessive eating) and hypersomnolence (excessive sleeping) occur.

Other genes associated with mood disorders 1062 include the genes that encode for dopamine transporters, the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein gene. Mood disorders are familial, and both unipolar depression and bipolar disorder are more common among family members of patients with mood disorders, as is alcoholism. Linkage studies have identified several chromosomal regions linked to bipolar disorder. While genetic factors explain approximately 50% to 70% of the etiology of mood disorders, environmental factors also play a large role. For example, traumatic childhood events predispose to mood disorders later in life. Hales RE, Yudofsky SC, Roberts LW, eds. The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry. 6th ed.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to be hypometabolic in patients with depression, whereas the orbitofrontal cortex is hypermetabolic, and pharmacologic therapies have been shown to reverse these changes. The pathophysiology of depression is complex, and dysfunction of one specific brain area does not account for the occurrence of depression. Rather, depression results from alterations in neuronal function in many brain areas and their connections. The subcallosal cingulate gyrus is one of the potential targets for deep brain stimulation for the treatment of depression; it is a central component of the limbic system and the connections between frontal and subcortical circuits, and is metabolically overactive in depression. Other potential targets include the ventral portion of the anterior limb of the internal capsule. While gross hippocampal volume is likely preserved in depression, hippocampal abnormalities have been demonstrated, and these at least in part relate to abnormalities in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal 1063 (HPA) axis and the effects of glucocorticoids on the hippocampus. Patients with depression have elevated levels of corticotropin- releasing hormone and other abnormalities of the HPA axis. Malone DA Jr, Dougherty DD, Rezai AR, et al.

      "explicacao": "The episodes described in question 7 are most consistent with panic attacks. Panic attacks are discrete episodes of symptoms that include a sense of intense fear, associated with other physical and/or psychiatric symptoms. Physical symptoms seen in panic attacks include palpitations or chest discomfort, diaphoresis, trembling, dyspnea, feeling of choking, nausea or abdominal pain, paresthesias, chills or hot flashes, and dizziness. Psychiatric symptoms include derealization (a feeling of unreality) or depersonalization (a feeling of being detached from oneself), fear of losing control, and fear of dying. Other types of panic attacks are cued, being situationally bound: occurring in relation to a specific internal or external trigger. Panic disorder is diagnosed when recurrent panic attacks occur. Panic disorder may occur in isolation or may be associated with agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is characterized by a fear of being in places or situations where escape would be difficult or embarrassing, or in which help would be difficult to obtain, as depicted in question 8. Agoraphobia may occur in isolation as well. The course of panic disorder is typically variable, with periods of exacerbations and remissions. Improvement occurs with age. The differential diagnosis of panic disorder includes several 1064 medical conditions that need to be excluded on the basis of the history and examination, including but not limited to thyroid disorders, pheochromocytoma, and arrhythmias or other primary cardiac conditions. Separation anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder of childhood characterized by excessive and inappropriate fear of being away from home or from familiar figures such as parents or siblings. It usually presents around 6 months of age and declines by ages 2 to 3 years, but may persist and/or recur during ages 6 to 12 years. Illness anxiety disorder (previously known as hypochondriasis) is discussed in question 22, cyclothymic disorder in question 12, posttraumatic stress disorder in question 19, and generalized anxiety disorder in question 18.

Some patients regain memory of the event, whereas others remain chronically amnestic for it. Depersonalization disorder is another dissociative disorder in which there are intermittent or constant feelings of detachment from oneself as if a person is viewing him- or herself as an outside observer. In another dissociative disorder, dissociative identity disorder (commonly known as “multiple personality disorder”), a person exists in two or more distinct identities or states, with these identities each unaware of the other and with each separately 1065 taking control of the person’s behavior over different time periods. Patients with dissociative fugue suddenly and unexpectedly travel away from their environment and are then unable to recall their past or their identity, and may assume a partial or completely new identity.

These symptoms include grandiosity, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and distractibility. Individuals experiencing a manic episode have or perceive a reduced need for sleep, and often become involved in several activities and projects. In situations where symptoms of both an acute manic episode and an acute depressive episode occur, with rapid shifts between or combinations of manic symptoms, psychotic symptoms, and/or depressive symptoms, a mixed episode may be specified. The patient depicted in question 10 had primarily manic symptoms. Symptoms of acute hypomanic episode are similar to those of acute manic episode but are milder and the patient characteristically has insight, without significant functional impairment. A prior history of depression is not required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder; one manic or hypomanic episode is all that is needed to diagnose bipolar I or II disorder respectively. However, 1066 in a patient with a depressive episode, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is not made unless there is a history of symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for acute manic or hypomanic episode.

      "explicacao": "The histories of the patients depicted in questions 13 and 14 are consistent with phobias, which are types of anxiety disorders. A phobia is an excessive fear of an object or situation. The phobias include agoraphobia (discussed in question 8), social phobia, and specific phobia. The main features of phobias include a fear of a clearly identifiable object or situation, with exposure invariably leading to an anxiety response and/or panic attack, resulting in active avoidance of the object or situation. There are five types of specific phobias: (i) animal type (phobia of animals in general or a specific animal, such as a dog, or spiders [arachnophobia]); (ii) natural environmental type (phobia for specific environmental or natural occurrences such as heights [acrophobia], thunderstorms, or water [hydrophobia]); (iii) blood- injury type (fear of blood [hemophobia] or of a bloody injury, or fear of needles [such as fear of venipuncture]); (iv) situational type (fear of specific situations or experiences such as fear of being in a closed space [claustrophobia] or transportation on airplanes or trains); and (v) other type (when the phobia does not fit into the latter four categories). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is characterized by functionally significant fear of social or performance situations, such as fear of speaking in front of an audience or fear of eating in front of others. There is often a fear of potential embarrassment. Patients with social anxiety disorder may be able to force themselves into the phobic situation but experience significant symptoms during that time. Phobias are among the most common psychiatric disorders. They are more common in females. Adults with phobias often recognize their phobias as being excessive or unreasonable, though children with phobias may not. Fear of blood is often familial, and may be associated with recurrent vasovagal attacks on exposure to blood. Comorbid anxiety disorders often occur. Situational phobias may also be familial, and are epidemiologically similar to panic disorder with agoraphobia. 1068 Generalized anxiety disorder is discussed in question 18. Panic disorder and agoraphobia are discussed in questions 7 and 8. Agoraphobia is a type of phobia, but differs from social phobia in that agoraphobia is fear of being in a social situation or place in which escape would be difficult, whereas social phobia is a fear of the social situation itself and its implications.

      "explicacao": "Serum concentrations of a medication do not necessarily reflect brain concentrations. This is in large part related to the blood– brain barrier (BBB) and blood–CSF barrier, which are selectively permeable barriers to diffusion or transport of substances from the bloodstream into the CNS. The BBB is formed from continuous tight junctions (not gap junctions) between brain capillary endothelial cells and also results from unique characteristics of pericapillary glial cells. The blood–CSF barrier is formed from tight junctions between epithelial cells in the choroid plexus. When intact, the BBB limits diffusion of most macromolecules and allows selective permeation of some small charged molecules (including neurotransmitter precursors and metabolites, and some drugs) through specific transport systems. Nonionized molecules and lipophilic (lipid-soluble) drugs have higher penetration into the CNS. Transport systems may also allow penetration of drugs into the CNS. The BBB also contains transport systems that allow efflux of substances out of the CNS. Metabolites of neurotransmitters are cleared through an acid transport system in the choroid plexus. The BBB does not exist in the peripheral nervous system, and is absent or less prominent in the circumventricular organs: the median eminence, area postrema, pineal gland, subfornical organ, and subcommissural organ. The BBB is disrupted by ischemia and inflammation, or can be intentionally disrupted with drugs such as 1069 mannitol, allowing access of substances that would not normally penetrate into the brain.

The main distinguishing feature between brief psychotic disorder (discussed in question 62) schizophreniform disorder, and schizophrenia (discussed in questions 24 and 25) is symptom duration, being up to 1 month in brief psychotic disorder, more than 1 month but less than 6 months in schizophreniform disorder, and 6 or more months in schizophrenia. Patients with these three disorders are typically managed similarly once the appropriate diagnostic workup has been completed (as discussed in question 45). Of patients with schizophreniform disorder, two-thirds eventually meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and one-third recover within 6 months of symptom onset.

Adult patients with OCD recognize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive. OCD typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, but can begin in childhood. It is equally common in males and females, though males have an earlier age of onset. Other psychiatric conditions that are frequently comorbid with OCD include depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and eating disorders. Approximately 50% of patients with Tourette’s syndrome also suffer from OCD. Deep brain stimulation of the ventral portion of the anterior limb of the internal capsule for the treatment of OCD is being studied with promising results.

Unlike panic disorder, which often improves with age, anxiety is significant during adulthood and older age. Posttraumatic stress disorder is discussed in question 19, illness anxiety disorder in questions 20–22, social phobia in questions 13 and 14, and panic disorder in questions 7 and 8.

These symptoms include reexperiencing the traumatic event (such as through nightmares or flashbacks), avoiding any stimuli associated with the event, and experiencing symptoms of autonomic arousal (such as increased startle reflex, insomnia, hypervigilance, and irritability). A diagnosis of PTSD is made only after symptoms have been occurring for more than 1 month; within a 1-month period of 1072 symptom onset, a diagnosis of acute stress reaction is made.

      "explicacao": "Somatic symptoms disorder (previously known as somatoform disorder) and related conditions, including conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, encompass disorders in which psychological stresses manifest as physical symptoms. As with the patient in question 20, somatic symptom disorder (previously known as somatization disorder) is characterized by the occurrence of multiple recurrent symptoms, affecting various systems, and cannot be fully explained by physical factors. In some cases, pain is the predominant symptom. Patients fixate on symptoms, and devote considerable thought, time, and energy to them, recurrently seeking medical attention, often resulting in excessive nondiagnostic testing and unnecessary medical treatments. Age of onset is typically prior to age 30. As with the patient depicted in question 21, conversion disorder is characterized by acute loss of motor or sensory function that cannot be explained by a neurologic or other medical condition. The symptoms often resemble neurologic syndromes, such as hemiparesis, cerebellar ataxia, or seizures. Nonneurologic symptoms such as blindness, deafness, or false pregnancy (pseudocyesis) also occur. Conversion disorder is also classified as 1073 a dissociative disorder in some texts. In illness anxiety disorder (which encompasses a disorder previously known as hypochondriasis), there is chronic and pervasive preoccupation with physical symptoms and fear of having a serious disease, often resulting from misinterpretation of physical symptoms, even after diagnostic testing and exclusion of the condition of concern or any other identifiable medical condition. As with the patient in question 22, patients with body dysmorphic disorder experience a chronic and intense preoccupation with a perceived defect of appearance or over- concern with minor physical abnormalities. Such patients often seek unnecessary and repeated surgical procedures to correct their perceived deformity. Somatic symptom disorder and related conditions are more frequent in women. Patients with these disorders often have a history of physical and/or emotional abuse and neglect. They frequently have comorbid psychiatric disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, and substance abuse. For example, one-third of patients with conversion disorder suffer from a mood or anxiety disorder, and half from a personality disorder. The key point distinguishing somatic symptom disorder and related conditions from factitious disorder is that in the former, symptoms are not intentionally feigned, whereas with factitious disorder, symptoms are voluntarily feigned for secondary gain. Factitious disorder is discussed further in question 44. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2013.

Although there is evidence to support this hypothesis, this is yet to be unequivocally proven, and some studies have not found alterations in monoamines in depressed patients. Evidence to support the monoamine hypothesis includes the induction of depression by reserpine, which depletes monoamines, increased risk for depression in carriers of specific serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphisms, and response of depression to medications that increase levels of monoamines. However, another theory of depression pathogenesis, the neurotrophic hypothesis, holds that depression results from loss of neurotrophic support by nerve growth factors such as brain-derived growth factor.

      "explicacao": "The history of the patient depicted in question 24 is consistent with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by both positive symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thought, and negative symptoms, such as emotional blunting, alogia (empty speech), apathy, and reduced communicativeness. In order for a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be made, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months (in contrast to brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder, as discussed in question 16). Schizophrenia affects 1% of the world’s population. It is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic populations, but the relationship between schizophrenia and socioeconomic status is complex. Low socioeconomic status is likely an effect rather than a cause of schizophrenia, relating to the “downward drift” effect, in which during the prodromal phase of schizophrenia an individual drifts 1075 down into a lower socioeconomic class. Schizophrenia is equally common in males and females, though males typically have a younger age of onset. Schizophrenia typically manifests in adolescence and early adulthood, though late-onset forms, with symptom onset after the age of 45, have also been described. Premorbidly (prior to the onset of positive symptoms), 25% of patients have abnormalities in social or cognitive function, with some features of schizoid personality disorder (discussed in question 41–43). Both positive and negative symptoms may occur simultaneously. Positive symptoms predominate in the earlier stages of the illness and may diminish overtime; positive symptoms are more responsive to typical antipsychotics compared to negative symptoms. Delusional disorder is discussed in question 31, brief psychotic episode in question 62, schizoaffective disorder in question 69, and schizoid personality disorder in question 41–43.

The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), as discussed in question 50, have various side effects including cardiac conduction abnormalities and drug–drug 1076 interactions that make them undesirable for the treatment of depression in older adults. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is more favorable than a TCA in this patient. Fluvoxamine has a high risk for drug–drug interactions, whereas escitalopram does not. Fluvoxamine also has high protein binding, and can therefore interact with anticoagulant medications, such a warfarin. Therefore, of the medications listed, escitalopram is the most appropriate in this patient.

Individuals with this disorder show little empathy or remorse. Conduct disorder is more common in males. Risk factors for conduct disorder include psychopathology in parents, dysfunctional family environment and poor parenting practices, exposure to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or neglect, and exposure to violence. A diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (discussed in questions 64–67), cannot be given to those younger than 18 years of age; some individuals with conduct disorder go on to meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder in adulthood, whereas in others, the conduct disorder remits and they are able to achieve adequate social and occupational adjustment. Management of conduct disorder centers primarily around institution of early multimodal psychosocial interventions to prevent conduct disorder when there are early signs of aggression or deviance in a child. 1077 Question 28 depicts oppositional defiant disorder. This is marked by a dysfunctional pattern of hostile and defiant behavior that cannot be explained by a mood or psychotic disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder most frequently emerges between ages 6 and 8, and is more common in males and those of lower socioeconomic status and in urban dwellers.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is synthesized from tryptophan (not tyramine) in a two-step process. The first step is catalyzed by tryptophan hydroxylase, which converts the essential amino acid tryptophan into an intermediate that is subsequently converted into serotonin by action of the enzyme aromatic L -amino acid decarboxylase. Serotonin is metabolized by action of monoamine oxidase (MAO) into 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde, which by action of aldehyde dehydrogenase is transformed to 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid. MAO-A is the predominant isoform in the metabolism of serotonin. MAO-B, along with MAO-A, metabolizes dopamine and tryptamine; low-dose selegiline is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B. There are at least seven classes and 14 subtypes of 5-HT receptors. The 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 2 , and 5-HT 4 subtypes are coupled to G- proteins (which either inhibit or activate adenylyl cyclase, depending on the subtype). The 5-HT 3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel. In the CNS, the principle site of serotonergic neuronal cell bodies is in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem, with diffuse projections to the brain and spinal cord. Serotonin has various actions both in the CNS and systemically. In the CNS, serotonin has a role to play in the sleep-wake cycle; serotonin deficiency leads to insomnia, and tryptophan (a serotonin precursor) promotes sleep. Serotonin has also been implicated in violent behavior; low CSF levels of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) have been associated with aggressiveness and violent impulsivity. Serotonin deficiency has also been implicated in both anxiety and 1079 depression. Regarding the nonpsychotropic effects of serotonin, the 5-HT 1B receptors elicit vasoconstriction and the 5-HT 1D receptors inhibit neuronal transmission and trigeminal neurogenic inflammatory peptide release. Triptan medications such as sumatriptan are agonists at these latter receptors. Action of serotonin at 5-HT 2A receptors leads to platelet aggregation. Serotonin acts at 5-HT 3 in the area postrema and the antiemetic ondansetron is an antagonist at this receptor. Serotonin is released by enterochromaffin cells in the intestines where it increases intestinal motility. It also induces bronchoconstriction, and patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome, in which there is excessive production of serotonin, manifest many of the symptoms of a hyperserotonergic state, including wheezing and diarrhea.

The rate of suicide increases with increasing age among Caucasians; in African Americans beyond the fourth decade, the rate of suicide decreases. Caucasians have a higher rate of suicide as compared to African Americans. Native Americans have the highest rate of suicide among all races/ethnicities in the United States. Approximately 60% to 70% of patients who have committed suicide were suffering from a mood disorder; patients with schizophrenia are also at an increased risk of suicide. Substance abuse and panic disorder are frequent comorbidities in patients who commit suicide. Among patients with personality disorders, those with borderline personality disorder (discussed in question 64–67) are most likely to attempt suicide. Sadock BJ, Sadock VA, Ruiz P, eds.

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have various systemic side effects related to action of serotonin at various 1081 receptor subtypes. The SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. They inhibit reuptake of serotonin through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, leading to increased availability of serotonin at the postsynaptic membrane. The antidepressant and/or anxiolytic effect of SSRIs may not become apparent for several days to weeks because their mechanism of action involves pre- and postsynaptic receptor changes that are not immediate. The SSRIs lead to various systemic effects due to the action of serotonin at various receptor subtypes (see question 30). They are used to treat mood disorders, including depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and seasonal affective disorder; a variety of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders, such as bulimia. The SSRIs are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and have various drug–drug interactions, with the extent varying with each of the SSRIs. Citalopram and escitalopram have the least potential for drug–drug interactions. At the time of this publication, the SSRIs are available only in oral formulation in the United States. Katzung BG.

        "e": "The dopamine hypothesis does not fully account for the manifestations of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders"
      },
      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "Schizophrenia (discussed in questions 24 and 25) and other psychotic disorders are thought to result, at least in part, from overactivity in dopaminergic pathways. Dopaminergic pathways include the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways (which project from the midbrain to the limbic system and neocortex), nigrostriatal pathway (which consists of neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum, including the caudate and putamen), and tuberoinfundibular system (which arises from the hypothalamus and projects to the pituitary; dopamine released 1082 by these neurons inhibits prolactin release from the pituitary). It is the limbic and cortical–subcortical pathways (mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways) that are thought to be overactive in psychosis, rather than the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways. There are five dopamine receptors identified, D 1 to D 5 . It is mainly the D 2 receptor that is implicated in the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Support for the dopamine hypothesis comes from evidence that there is increased dopamine receptor density in the brains of schizophrenics postmortem and increased D 2 receptor occupancy in the brains of schizophrenics on functional imaging. Improvement of psychosis with D 2 antagonism and worsening of psychosis with dopaminergic agonists such as levodopa, amphetamines, and dopamine agonists further lend support to this theory. However, the dopamine hypothesis only partially explains the many features of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. For example, reduced dopaminergic activity in specific cortical areas including the medial temporal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the hippocampus is thought to underlie the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates a role for excessive serotonergic activity, particularly at serotonergic 5-HT 2A receptors, in the pathogenesis of hallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis. The occurrence of hallucinations with exposure to lysergic acid diethylamide (discussed in Chapter 17 ), a serotonin agonist, lends support to this theory, as does the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics, which have serotonergic antagonism in addition to antidopaminergic activity. Underactivity of glutamate pathways, which normally excite inhibitory GABA pathways, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, as evidenced by the ability of phencyclidine and ketamine (noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, discussed in Chapter 17 ) to exacerbate cognitive dysfunction and psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.

      "explicacao": "The eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and eating disorder not otherwise specified. The case in question 37 depicts anorexia nervosa, a disorder characterized by restricted energy intake relative to the requirements and resulting in a significantly low body weight. In an individual with anorexia nervosa there is disturbed perception of one’s body weight/shape, an intense fear of gaining weight, and an impaired self-perception of weight (such as denial of the seriousness of low body weight). Anorexia nervosa is of two types: The first is a restricting type, which occurs in approximately 50% of patients, in which there is self-induced starvation and often compulsive exercising without binge eating or purging behaviors. The second type is a binge eating/purging type, in which the patient regularly engages in binge eating followed by purging. Anorexia nervosa is treated at least initially in the inpatient setting to allow for medical stabilization and initiation of nutrition under close supervision. Later, outpatient therapy revolves mainly around psychotherapy, with pharmacologic management of comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. In bulimia nervosa, depicted in question 38, patients binge and subsequently partake in compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain such as excessive exercise, induction of emesis or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications. In contrast to anorexia nervosa, patients with bulimia nervosa typically maintain a normal body weight. In patients with bulimia nervosa, self-assessment is unduly influenced by body weight and shape. Treatment of bulimia nervosa involves psychotherapy combined in some cases with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (discussed in question 33). Bulimia nervosa is a common comorbidity seen in persons with 1085 borderline personality disorder (discussed in questions 64–67). In binge eating disorder, binge eating occurs over discrete periods. During episodes of binge eating, there is a sense of lack of control, embarrassment (by how much one is eating), and/or guilt. Bulimia nervosa is distinguished from binge eating disorder in that in the latter, inappropriate compensatory behaviors do not occur. In patients with eating disorder not otherwise specified, patients may avoid food, binge with or without purging or participating excessively in exercise, and partake in other methods of minimizing weight loss, but the patient’s weight is maintained within the normal range. Menstruation remains regular. The binge eating form of eating disorder not otherwise specified is the most common eating disorder, followed by bulimia and anorexia nervosa. Peak onset of eating disorders is in the teenage years, though they may begin at any age. Eating disorders are more common in females than in males, with a 3:1 ratio, though males are likely underdiagnosed. The pathophysiology relates to be both environmental and genetic factors; there is a 50% to 80% concordance rate among monozygotic twins. Comorbid mood, anxiety, and personality disorders are common among patients with eating disorders. The impulse control disorders are discussed in questions 35 and 36.

The TCAs do not directly inhibit reuptake of dopamine, though they may indirectly facilitate the effects of dopamine. All TCAs have some activity at muscarinic, histaminergic, and α 1 -adrenergic receptors, though to varying degrees.

      "explicacao": "The personality disorders consist of 10 distinct entities that share in common a chronic and pervasive pattern of inner experiences, thoughts, and behaviors. They affect the domains of cognition, impulse control, affectivity, and interpersonal functioning. Features are present in adolescence or early adulthood and persist over time. They deviate from accepted societal culture and norms and lead to distress or impairment. The caveat to the diagnosis of personality disorders is that the features do not occur in the context of signs or symptoms that are part of a mood, anxiety, impulse control, or psychotic disorder, or any other psychiatric disorder as the primary underlying illness. Personality traits are patterns of behavior or thinking about oneself and the environment that are relatively consistent over time, but they do not lead to a diagnosis of personality disorder unless they are maladaptive or cause functional impairment or distress. The personality disorders are categorized into clusters A, B, and C. Different personality disorders may co-occur in the same individual. questions 41 to 43 depict people that would be classified under cluster A of the personality disorders. This cluster includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders. Paranoid personality disorder, depicted in question 41, is marked by pervasive distrust, paranoia, and suspiciousness of others. Persons with paranoid personality disorders have an increased risk of comorbid major depressive disorder (discussed in questions 1 and 2), substance abuse, and agoraphobia (discussed in questions 7–8). Paranoid personality disorder is more common in males and may be an antecedent to paranoid type of delusional disorder (discussed 1088 in question 31). Schizoid personality disorder, depicted in question 42, is marked by blunted range of affect and emotions. There is a lack of interest in or enjoyment of social relationships and intimacy. Individuals with this disorder exhibit little pleasure in social activities, with a preference for solitude, and lack close friends outside of the immediate family. Schizoid personality disorder is more common in males, and may appear as an antecedent to delusional disorder (discussed in question 31) or schizophrenia (discussed in questions 24 and 25). Schizotypal personality disorder, depicted in question 43, is marked by odd, peculiar, and eccentric ideas, beliefs, and/or behaviors including magical thinking (such as superstitiousness or belief in clairvoyance or telepathy), paranoid ideation, and constricted affect. Individuals with this personality disorder have social anxiety and are uncomfortable with close relationships; they typically lack close friends outside of immediate family members. Patients with schizotypal personality disorder have comorbid major depression in 30% to 50% of cases. Patients with personality disorders lack insight into their pathology, but may be asked to seek care from a psychiatrist by family members or others in the setting of dysfunction in relationships, occupation, or otherwise. Treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy combined with pharmacotherapy aimed at the most prominent psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiolytics if anxiety is the main symptom, or mood stabilizers or antipsychotics if lability, aggression, and impulsivity are the most prominent symptoms).

      "explicacao": "The personality disorders consist of 10 distinct entities that share in common a chronic and pervasive pattern of inner experiences, thoughts, and behaviors. They affect the domains of cognition, impulse control, affectivity, and interpersonal functioning. Features are present in adolescence or early adulthood and persist over time. They deviate from accepted societal culture and norms and lead to distress or impairment. The caveat to the diagnosis of personality disorders is that the features do not occur in the context of signs or symptoms that are part of a mood, anxiety, impulse control, or psychotic disorder, or any other psychiatric disorder as the primarily underlying illness. Personality traits are patterns of behavior or thinking about oneself and the environment that are relatively consistent over time, but they do not lead to a diagnosis of personality disorder unless they are maladaptive or cause functional impairment or distress. The personality disorders are categorized into clusters A, B, and C. Different personality disorders may co-occur in the same individual. questions 46 to 48 depict people that would be classified under cluster C of the personality disorders. This cluster includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Avoidant personality disorder, depicted in question 46, is marked 1091 by hypersensitivity to criticism, feelings of inadequacy, and social inhibition. Individuals with this disorder may avoid an occupation or other activity that will involve contact with others because of fear of criticism or rejection. They may show restraint in personal relationships because of fear of being ridiculed, and are willing to get involved with people only if certain of being liked. They often view themselves as socially inept and inferior to others. Unlike persons with schizoid personality disorder (depicted in question 42), those with avoidant personality disorder want relationships but avoid them because of fear of criticism, whereas those with schizoid personality disorder prefer social isolation. Avoidant personality disorder shares features with panic disorder with agoraphobia (discussed in questions 7 and 8) but in the latter condition, avoidance is of specific social situations that lead to panic attacks. Avoidant personality disorder begins at an early age, without clear precipitants, and is stable over time. Social phobia (discussed in questions 13 and 14) and avoidant personality disorder may co-occur. Individuals with dependent personality disorder, depicted in question 47 have a chronic and excessive need to be taken care of. They may be clingy and have fear of separation. They have difficulty making day-to-day decisions without advice and reassurance from others, and prefer for others to assume responsibility for major areas of life. They are submissive and avoid disagreement with others for fear of loss of approval. They lack self-confidence and consequently avoid initiating projects or doing things independently. Individuals with this disorder may feel helpless when alone because of fear of being unable to care of themselves, and may urgently seek a new relationship as a source of care if another relationship ends. Dependent personality disorder is equally common in males and females, and is one of the most common personality disorders. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, depicted in question 48, is marked by a dysfunctional and unproductive preoccupation with orderliness, perfection, and control at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. Individuals with this disorder are perfectionists without this necessarily being productive. They are rigid and inflexible in various aspects of life including in work and 1092 in relationships. They often prioritize work at the expense of leisure activities or friendship. Some individuals with this personality disorder have difficulty parting with unneeded objects (to the extent of hoarding in some cases). Although obsessive- compulsive disorder (discussed in question 17) may coexist with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, distinct and definable obsessions and compulsions are absent in the latter, distinguishing the two. Patients with personality disorders lack insight into their pathology, but may be asked to seek care from a psychiatrist by family members or others in the setting of dysfunction in relationships, occupation, or otherwise. Treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy combined with pharmacotherapy aimed at the most prominent psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiolytics if anxiety is the main symptom, or mood stabilizers or antipsychotics if lability, aggression, and impulsivity are the most prominent symptoms).

      "explicacao": "Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) lead to urinary retention due to inhibition of detrusor function, rather than bladder overactivity. Because the TCAs all have, to varying degrees, activity at muscarinic, histaminergic, and α 1 -adrenergic receptors, they have various side effects. Antagonism at histamine receptors leads to sedation, xerostomia, and weight gain. Antimuscarinic activity leads to constipation, tachycardia, blurred vision (with increased risk of glaucoma), and urinary retention, and hence imipramine is used to treat overactive bladder and enuresis. α 1 -Adrenergic antagonism can lead to postural hypotension, which can be particularly detrimental in older adults. Of the commonly used TCAs, amitriptyline has the highest antimuscarinic activity and α 1 - adrenergic activity. Nortriptyline has the least α 1 -adrenergic antagonism and is therefore less likely to cause orthostatic hypotension. Doxepin has the highest antihistamine activity, and is therefore the most sedating. At toxic doses, TCAs can cause confusion, seizures, and arrhythmias. TCAs are metabolized through oxidation by various cytochrome P450 isozymes and subsequently undergo glucuronidation. Because their metabolism is strongly dependent on cytochrome P450 enzymes, they have various drug–drug interactions. Brunton LL, Blumenthal DK, Murri N, et al, eds.

      "explicacao": "Matt and Tom, the boys depicted in question 51, exhibit the features of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In ADHD, symptoms start before age 12, are functionally impairing, and are not consistent with developmental level. ADHD may present with predominantly inattentive symptoms (such as difficulty sustaining attention on a given task and are easily 1094 distractible), as in Matt. ADHD may also present with predominantly hyperactive symptoms (such as fidgetiness, restlessness, and impatience), as in Tom. In some patients, a combination of these occurs. Although the etiology of ADHD is not clear, dysfunction in frontal-subcortical circuits has been implicated. Genetic studies have suggested involvement of genes related to dopamine action or metabolism, though environmental factors play a role as well. Children of parents with ADHD and siblings of children with ADHD are more likely to be affected with ADHD than the general population. Oppositional defiant disorder (discussed in question 28) is a distinct entity from ADHD, but the two are often comorbid. Similarly, generalized anxiety disorder (discussed in question 18), is also comorbid with ADHD, as are the disruptive behavior disorders (discussed in questions 27 and 28). Tic disorder also frequently occurs with ADHD. In childhood, academic failure and peer rejection are the major consequences of ADHD, whereas in adolescence there is a threefold increase in substance use and abuse. Approximately 60% of patients with ADHD in childhood continue to be impaired in adult life; ADHD may also not be recognized until adulthood. Adults with ADHD typically show instability with employment and relationships. The first line of treatment for ADHD are psychostimulants including amphetamines and methylphenidates, of which there are various oral preparations. Common side effects include reduced appetite, weight loss, insomnia, and headaches. An electrocardiogram prior to initiation of stimulant medications is recommended to exclude underlying structural or conduction problems. Other medications used to treat ADHD include the nonstimulant atomoxetine, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and the α 2 -agonist clonidine. Psychosocial treatment is also an important part of managing ADHD. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2013.

Tolerance to this side effect typically develops after a few days of therapy. SSRIs cause sexual dysfunction, particularly leading to erectile dysfunction in men. They can lead to irritability and increased suicidal thoughts, particularly in younger age groups. Some of the SSRIs can lead to insomnia, whereas others are more sedating. Sertraline is one of the least sedating SSRIs.

      "explicacao": "Despite the development of newer antipsychotic agents (see questions 72–74), the typical antipsychotics are still commonly used; randomized controlled trials have shown the typical antipsychotics to be efficacious and cost-effective. The typical antipsychotics exert their antipsychotic effect predominantly by antagonism at D 2 receptors. The antipsychotics are first-line agents in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other psychotic disorders, including depression with psychotic features. Antipsychotics are also used as augmentation therapy in 1096 major depressive disorder and in the treatment of delirium, Tourette’s syndrome (see Chapter 6 ), and behavioral and psychotic symptoms of dementia (discussed in question 70). The typical antipsychotics, first brought into clinical use in the 1950s, include chlorpromazine and thioridazine, which have low potency at D 2 (dopamine) receptors and higher antagonism at muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors. They are therefore more likely to cause side effects related to antagonism at these receptors, such as dry mouth, orthostasis, and sedation, respectively. Those with higher potency at D 2 receptors, such as haloperidol and fluphenazine, have activity at muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors as well and can lead to similar side effects, but are less likely to do so. On the other hand, they are more likely to lead to extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), which result from D 2 - antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway. The EPS can be divided into acute reactions such as acute dystonia, which are in general reversible with treatment with antimuscarinic agents such as benztropine, and tardive dyskinesia (such as the orolingual dyskinesias depicted in question 55, or tardive cervical dystonia), which are in general irreversible but may be treatable with botulinum toxin or deep brain stimulation to the globus pallidus interna (see Chapter 6 ). Many of the typical antipsychotic agents can be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly, making them convenient in the treatment of psychotic patients for whom oral administration is difficult. Prochlorperazine is an antidopaminergic agent used predominantly in the treatment of nausea. Brunton LL, Blumenthal DK, Murri N, et al, eds.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Buspirone is an anxiolytic agent without sedative–hypnotic activity. Its mechanism of action involves partial agonism at serotonergic (5-HT 1A ) receptors. It also has some activity at dopaminergic D 2 receptors. The benzodiazepines belong to a class of medications known as the sedative-hypnotics by nature of their ability to induce an anxiolytic calming effect and sleep. They include alprazolam, midazolam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, triazolam, flurazepam, clorazepate, oxazepam, and diazepam. They act at GABA A receptors, facilitating the action of GABA and increasing chloride conductance. The benzodiazepines may be used in the treatment of acute anxiety, as is seen in generalized anxiety disorder (discussed in question 18), panic disorder, and agoraphobia (discussed in questions 7 and 8). However, chronic use leads to tolerance 1098 (decreased response to a specific dose after repeated exposure) as well as physiologic dependence. Other adverse effects include memory disturbance, sedation, and respiratory depression in overdose (or even at therapeutic doses in those with pulmonary disease). Chronic therapy for anxiety disorders therefore includes medications such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. The latter medications do not have acute effects on anxiety, and in the initial weeks of therapy, benzodiazepines are often used as adjuncts until the anxiolysis takes effect. Of the benzodiazepines, flurazepam and clorazepate have the longest half- lives. Triazolam has a rapid onset and short duration of action. Besides the treatment of acute anxiety, benzodiazepines are also used in the treatment of seizures, alcohol withdrawal, spasticity and movement disorders, and insomnia. Several benzodiazepines are available in various oral, sublingual, intravenous, and intramuscular formulations (including but not limited to midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam), making them useful in the treatment of emergencies such as status epilepticus, as well as in anesthesia.

For the prior few weeks, he had been increasingly sleepy, and that morning, he could barely be aroused. He has a chronic history of depression and was started on fluoxetine 2 months earlier. He also suffers from coronary artery disease, hypertension for which he is on a thiazide diuretic, and cirrhosis.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Hyponatremia is an established side effect of therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Risk factors include older age, female sex, and concomitant use of diuretics. Hyponatremia resulting from SSRIs typically occurs within the first month of therapy, but may not occur until several months after initiation of therapy. Among the SSRIs, fluoxetine and paroxetine are more likely to lead to hyponatremia. The pathophysiology of SSRI- induced hyponatremia is thought to be at least in part related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, resulting from excessive release of antidiuretic hormone mediated by activation of serotonergic receptors. Although there are no definitive data to support routine monitoring of serum sodium in patients started on an SSRI, any change in mentation or other symptoms potentially suggesting hyponatremia should prompt a laboratory evaluation for this complication. In isovolemic hyponatremia due to SSRIs, the treatment is discontinuation of the SSRI along with fluid restriction. In more severe symptomatic hyponatremia, treatment with intravenous sodium chloride may be indicated. Rechallenge with SSRIs may not necessarily lead to recurrent hyponatremia, though it can.

Schizophrenia aggregates in families, and the results of epidemiologic studies, twin studies, adoption studies, and genetic linkage and association studies suggest that schizophrenia is a genetic disorder, with phenotypic expression of the disorder being influenced by a variety of environmental factors. The concordance rate (the rate of twins that are each affected) for schizophrenia is higher among monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins. Several schizophrenia susceptibility loci have been mapped to various chromosomes, with candidate genes including dysbindin on chromosome 6 and neuregulin-1 on chromosome 8. Other genetic abnormalities detected in schizophrenia include chromosomal deletions, trinucleotide repeat expansions, and copy number variants. Evidence from genome-wide association studies have identified several potential single-nucleotide polymorphisms that may be significantly associated with risk of schizophrenia, including polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes.

Symptoms include encephalopathy, autonomic hyperactivity manifesting as hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, as well as myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and tremor. Serotonin syndrome can occur with any agent that increases serotonin, and has even been reported with monotherapy, but is more likely to occur with a combination of therapies that increase 1101 serotonin, and particularly with concomitant use of nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Treatment generally includes supportive care and withdrawal of the offending agent. Serotonin withdrawal syndrome can occur with abrupt discontinuation of serotonergic medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Symptoms include dizziness, paresthesias, dysphoria, and in some cases encephalopathy. Therefore, gradual tapering of such medications is generally recommended.

Disorders of this enzyme lead to a deficiency in GABA and subsequently overactivation in the CNS, as is seen in stiff person syndrome. The GABA A receptor is an example of an ionotropic receptor, activation of which leads to opening of chloride channels. The GABA B receptor is an example of a metabotropic receptor, which is coupled to an inhibitory G- protein, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase.

      "explicacao": "The personality disorders consist of 10 distinct entities that share in common a chronic and pervasive pattern of inner experiences, thoughts, and behaviors. They affect the domains of cognition, impulse control, affectivity, and interpersonal functioning. Features are present in adolescence or early adulthood and persist over time. They deviate from accepted societal culture and norms and lead to distress or impairment. The caveat to the diagnosis of personality disorders is that the features do not occur in the context of signs or symptoms that are part of a mood, anxiety, impulse control, or psychotic disorder, or any other psychiatric disorder as the primarily underlying illness. Personality traits are patterns of behavior or thinking about oneself and the environment that are relatively consistent over time, but they do not lead to a diagnosis of personality disorder unless they are maladaptive or cause functional impairment or distress. The personality disorders are categorized into clusters A, B, and C. Different personality 1103 disorders may co-occur in the same individual. questions 64 to 67 depict people that would be classified under cluster B of the personality disorders. This cluster includes narcissistic, antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders. Narcissistic personality disorder, depicted in question 64, is marked by grandiosity and a sense of self-importance. These individuals are arrogant and preoccupied by perceived positive attributes such as success or beauty, believe that they are superior to others, and have a sense of self-entitlement. On the other hand they have fears of others seeing their flaws. They manipulate others to achieve ends in their own self-interest, often at the expense of the interest of others. Individuals with this disorder also lack empathy. Narcissistic personality disorder is more common in males, and major depression (discussed in questions 1 and 2) and substance abuse are common comorbidities. Antisocial personality disorder, depicted in question 65, is marked by disrespect of others and the law, starting since age 15. Individuals with this disorder exhibit deceptiveness, impulsivity, aggressiveness, recklessness, and irresponsibility (in the workplace, financially, etc.). They lack remorse, with indifference to harming others. Conduct disorder (discussed in question 27) is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder; antisocial personality disorder cannot be diagnosed in those younger than 18. Impulse control disorder (discussed in questions 35 and 36) may occur in persons with antisocial personality disorder, but the other features of antisocial personality disorder discussed distinguish the two. Antisocial personality disorder is three times more common in males as compared to females. Borderline personality disorder, depicted in question 66, is marked by pervasive instability in various aspects including self- image, relationships, and affect. In their interactions with and perception of others, individuals with this disorder alternate between idealization and devaluation (so-called splitting ). They have an intense fear of abandonment and go to extremes to avoid this. They often engage in self-injurious behavior including suicidal gesture or threats, or self-mutilation. The instability and extremism extends to eating behaviors and sexuality. Borderline personality 1104 disorder is more common in females. Frequent comorbidities include major depression, eating disorder (particularly bulimia; discussed in question 37–38), and substance abuse. Histrionic personality disorder, depicted in question 67, is marked by attention-seeking behavior, including constant need to be the center of attention and inappropriately seductive or provocative behavior. Individuals with this disorder use their physical appearance to draw attention to themselves, and may be theatrical and dramatic. They also exhibit excessive emotionality and have shallow and rapidly shifting emotions. Histrionic personality disorder is more common in females, and common comorbidities include major depression, conversion disorder, and somatic symptom disorder. Patients with personality disorders lack insight into their pathology, but may be asked to seek care from a psychiatrist by family members or others in the setting of dysfunction in relationships, occupation, or otherwise. Treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy combined with pharmacotherapy aimed at the most prominent psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiolytics if anxiety is the main symptom, or mood stabilizers or antipsychotics if lability, aggression, and impulsivity are the most prominent symptoms).

      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "Duloxetine and venlafaxine are serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): They inhibit reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, respectively. The SNRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), because they increase both norepinephrine and serotonin, are useful in the treatment of pain disorders. Unlike the TCAs, the SNRIs are relatively selective and have little activity at muscarinic, 1105 histaminergic, and α-adrenergic receptors. Mirtazapine has complex pharmacology; it acts as an antagonist at presynaptic α 2 -receptors, increasing release of norepinephrine and serotonin, and also acts as an antagonist at 5-HT 2 and 5-HT 3 receptors. Its potent antagonism at histamine receptors accounts for its sedating effects. The mechanism of action of bupropion is not well understood, but animal studies have shown that it inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and increases presynaptic release of these neurotransmitters, without direct effects on the serotonin system. At high doses, bupropion increases risk of seizures. Bupropion, in addition to its use as an antidepressant, is used in smoking cessation. Trazodone and nefazodone act primarily by antagonism at the 5- HT 2 receptor; trazodone was initially used as an antidepressant, but its primary use today is as a hypnotic (sedative) because it is highly sedating and little tolerance develops to its sedating effect over time. An adverse effect that may occur with trazodone therapy is priapism or prolonged painful erection. Phenelzine and isocarboxazid are nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and are among the oldest antidepressants, rarely used in clinical practice today due to their side effect profile. Because nonselective MAOIs block metabolism of tyramine, found in certain foods such as cheese and wine, a lethal reaction resulting from hyperadrenergic state can occur with use of MAOIs, particularly when taken with other agents that increase serotonin.

Electroconvulsive therapy (discussed in question 80) can be effective after 8 to 12 sessions, but is often reserved for medication-resistant depression because of cognitive side effects. Clear superiority of one antidepressant over another has not been demonstrated in meta-analyses, and choice of antidepressant may depend more on side effect profile, risk of drug–drug interactions, cost, and other such factors unrelated to efficacy.

A sedating agent such as a tricyclic antidepressant or mirtazapine may help with his poor sleep. Venlafaxine can cause a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure, and may be best avoided in a patient with known hypertension. Less than 50% of patients respond to the initial antidepressant selected, and augmentation with another agent or discontinuation with switching to an agent from another class is often necessary. Several algorithms have been developed to aid physicians in selection of the most appropriate antidepressant. The duration of therapy depends on the patient’s psychiatric history, response to treatment, and relapse rate. More than 80% of patients with an episode of major depression have at least one recurrence during their lifetime, and sometimes long-term and even life-long maintenance therapy with an antidepressant is required.

      "explicacao": "The second generation of antipsychotics, so-called atypical antipsychotics, includes clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. These agents do have antagonistic activity at D 2 (dopamine) receptors, however, their clinical antipsychotic effect results in large part from antagonism at serotonergic 5-HT 2A receptors. Studies to date have not shown overall superior efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics over the typical ones, though atypical antipsychotics may be more effective at treating some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Because they have less antagonism at D 2 receptors, they are less likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), but certainly can. As a class, the atypical antipsychotics carry with them an increased risk of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Patients being treated with these medications should therefore periodically be assessed for such side effects. Clozapine and olanzapine are most likely to lead to weight gain. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are less likely to cause weight gain than the others. Some of the typical and atypical antipsychotics including thioridazine, haloperidol, ziprasidone, and quetiapine have negative ionotropic action on the heart and a quinidine-like effect, leading to QT prolongation with the potential for arrhythmias. Aripiprazole is least likely to do so. Other cardiac side effects include myocarditis, which can rarely be seen with clozapine. The atypical antipsychotics also have activity at muscarinic, adrenergic, and histaminergic receptors, and several side effects result from activity at these sites. Clozapine can lead to agranulocytosis in 1% to 2% of patients, and patients being treated with this medication are required to have periodic complete blood counts checked. Clozapine also leads to a dose-dependent increased risk of seizures. Clozapine is least likely of all the atypical antipsychotics to lead to EPS. Because of the side effect profile of clozapine, its use is usually limited to treatment of patients who have failed trials of other typical and atypical antipsychotics. Among the atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine has the highest antimuscarinic activity, and side effects resulting from this include dry mouth, urinary 1109 retention, confusion, and constipation. Clozapine also has significant antimuscarinic activity. Quetiapine has significant antihistaminergic activity, and along with olanzapine, is the most likely to lead to sedation. Dopamine inhibits prolactin release, and treatment with both typical and atypical antipsychotics can lead to hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea resulting from dopaminergic antagonism in the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Some of the atypical antipsychotics are available in injectable forms, including long-acting depot formulations. Brunton LL, Blumenthal DK, Murri N, et al, eds.

Specific patterns of activation of NMDA receptors can lead to induction of long-term 1110 potentiation, which is a prolonged increase in a postsynaptic response resulting from a finite presynaptic stimulus and is thought to be involved in memory formation. High concentrations of glutamate lead to neuronal cell death triggered by excessive glutamate receptor activation, with excessive calcium influx into cells. Glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in neuronal damage seen in ischemia and hypoglycemia. Memantine is an NMDA antagonist used in the treatment of dementia.

Mood-stabilizing agents used to treat bipolar disorder include lithium carbonate, as well as the anticonvulsants including valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. Antipsychotic agents including risperidone and quetiapine are used as adjuncts in the 1111 treatment of acute mania. The depressive phase of bipolar disorder often warrants concurrent antidepressant therapy. Mood-stabilizing agents are also used in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. The mechanism of action of lithium carbonate is not clear, but does include inhibition of the inositol and glycogen synthase kinase 3 signal pathways and downstream enzyme activity. Serum levels of lithium should be monitored periodically. Common adverse effects of lithium include tremor, thyroid dysfunction, acne, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which can lead to hypernatremia if there is not adequate oral intake of fluids, as in the case depicted in question 79.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "Several brain stimulation modalities are available for the treatment of depression, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Electroconvulsive therapy can be a highly effective therapy for depression. It is most commonly used for major depression refractory to medications but is also used acutely in depression (without a prior drug trial) when necessary. Suicide is not a contraindication for ECT. Other indications for ECT include schizoaffective disorders, schizophrenia, and mania (particularly in bipolar patients with a mixed episode [of both mania and depression] or rapidly cycling bipolar disorder). In ECT, an electric current is applied to the scalp in an anesthetized patient, with the goal of inducing a nonconvulsive seizure. The mechanism of action of the antidepressant effects of ECT is not well understood. Side 1112 effects include retrograde amnesia, which can be partially irreversible. In TMS, a rapidly changing magnetic field is applied to the scalp and is thought to affect the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, locally inducing small electric currents. Single-pulse TMS is generally considered safe but seizures are nevertheless a potential risk, even in individuals without a prior history of epilepsy. Application of TMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improves symptoms in major depression. In VNS, intermittent electrical stimulation is directly applied via an electrode to the left cervical vagus nerve. The current is provided by a pulse generator, a pacemaker-sized device that is implanted in the chest and is connected to the electrode. Stimulation of the afferent vagus nerve fibers leads to changes in several brainstem nuclei that are involved in the pathophysiology of depression, such as the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and raphe nuclei, leading to alterations in serotonergic activity in cortical and limbic structures. VNS is used as adjunctive therapy for chronic or recurrent depression in individuals with either unipolar depression or bipolar disorder. Sadock BJ, Sadock VA, Ruiz P, eds.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "The main embryonal layer giving rise to the nervous system is the ectoderm. In early stages of nervous system development, a structure known as the neural plate forms. The notochord, a layer of mesodermal cells in contact with the ectoderm, induces formation of the neural plate from the ectoderm and later signals differentiation of various cell types mediated by inductive signals. The notochord later gives rise to the vertebral column. The neural plate forms a structure known as the neural tube through a process called neurulation. Neurulation involves proliferation and migration of ectodermal cells and invagination, folding, and fusion of the neural plate in a specific pattern. An important step in neurulation includes the formation of a midline groove along which the lateral margins of the neural plate fold. These lateral margins start to fuse in the center, so that for a period of time, there are openings at each end, the anterior and posterior neuropore. Fusion then reaches the neuropores, the anterior one first, then the posterior one, and the neural tube is thus formed. The ventral and dorsal aspects of the neural tube each give rise to specific cell populations and ultimately specific parts of the nervous system. As mentioned, mesodermal cells of the notochord provide a signal for differentiation to cells in the ventral aspect of the neural tube. This signal is the sonic hedgehog protein. Cell differentiation in the dorsal half of the neural tube depends on signals secreted by the lateral epidermal ectoderm. These signals are the bone morphogenetic proteins, of which several types have been identified. Neurulation occurs at 3 to 6 weeks’ gestation, and failure of crucial processes at any stage leads to a variety of abnormalities, collectively known as neural tube defects (NTDs). As mentioned, 1169 the neural plate undergoes fusion to form the neural tube in different areas at different times, and failure to fuse at each site results in specific defects. Abnormal rostral fusion at the anterior neuropore leads to abnormalities such as encephalocele or anencephaly, whereas abnormal caudal fusion (at the posterior neuropore) leads to disorders such as spina bifida. Following neurulation, the neural tube undergoes segmentation into three vesicles, in a process called specification, whereby different segments begin to acquire cell types and characteristics specific to the central nervous system (CNS) structure that will eventually arise from them (malformations resulting from defects in this stage of development are further discussed in questions 8, 11, 16, and 19). The three segments include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon subsequently forms the telencephalon, which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres, as well as the diencephalon, which forms the hypothalamus and the thalamus. The mesencephalon gives rise to the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon gives rise to the rest of the brainstem (pons and medulla) and the cerebellum. Abnormalities during specification, which occurs at 5 to 6 weeks of gestation, lead to disorders such as septo-optic dysplasia (discussed in question 30). As the nervous system becomes more organized and specific areas more specialized, neuronal migration begins along specific routes, and abnormalities of neuronal proliferation and migration in turn lead to specific developmental abnormalities (discussed in questions 36, 38, 44, 45 and 53). The peripheral nervous system (including the autonomic ganglia) forms from neural crest cells that are derived from the neural tube after it fuses. In addition to peripheral nervous system structures, neural crest cells give rise to the chromaffin tissue of the adrenal medulla and melanocytes. Swaiman KF, Ashwal S, Ferriero DM, et al.

Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency is the most common cause of galactosemia, leading to classic galactosemia, and is the only type associated with intellectual impairment. Patients present in the first days of life with feeding difficulties, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice. They also have hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, lethargy, and hypotonia. Cataracts also occur and are caused by an accumulation of galactitol. Late neurologic sequelae include developmental delay, cognitive impairment, ataxia, and tremor, with brain MRI demonstrating white matter changes and cortical and cerebellar atrophy. Prenatal diagnosis of galactosemia can be made, and newborn screening is available for this condition, thus allowing for treatment prior to the onset of symptoms. The diagnosis can be presumed in patients presenting with the clinical manifestations described and the detection of reducing substances in the urine, especially after feeding. The enzymatic defect can be detected in plasma and/or erythrocytes. Lactose and galactose should be immediately restricted from the diet.

Thinning of the cortex of long bones and other long bone dysplasias may lead to pathologic fractures and pseudarthrosis. Other skeletal abnormalities in NF1 include scoliosis and sphenoid wing dysplasia. NF1 is further discussed in questions 46 to 48. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "This patient has a glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT-1) deficiency. The brain utilizes glucose as its primary source of energy. In fasting conditions, glycogen is exhausted within minutes, and since amino acids and fat cannot be used for the production of energy in the brain, ketones become the alternative fuel. Glucose crosses the blood–brain barrier facilitated by GLUT-1, which is a membrane- bound protein encoded by the SLC2A1 gene on chromosome 1p34.2. The majority of SLC2A1 gene mutations are de novo, with familial cases being inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This mutation causes a defect in glucose transport across the blood–brain barrier and into brain cells. There is phenotypic heterogeneity with GLUT-1 mutations. Some cases manifest with an epileptic encephalopathy with infantile-onset seizures, developmental delay, microcephaly, and complex involuntary 1173 movements, as in the case depicted in question 7. However, later- onset forms with episodic involuntary movements and/or ataxia have been described, as in paroxysmal exertional dyskinesias. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level is low with a normal serum glucose level, and other CSF studies are normal, excluding other causes of hypoglycorrhachia (such as CNS infection). Electroencephalogram (EEG) may show 2.5 to 4 Hz spikes and waves and the interictal EEG findings may improve with glucose. However, EEG findings are not specific, and some patients may have normal interictal EEG. Neuroimaging does not show specific abnormalities. Ketogenic diet should be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, since this treatment option improves seizure control and the abnormal movements; however, it is less effective for the psychomotor impairment.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "The neural plate fuses to form the neural tube at different sites and at different times, and failure of fusion at these various sites leads to various NTDs (also discussed in questions 1 to 3, 11, 16, and 19). Failure of fusion rostrally, at the anterior neuropore, leads to anencephaly and encephalocele. The anterior neuropore fuses by day 26 of gestation, and abnormalities in neurulation leading to these disorders, therefore, likely occur at or prior to this time (weeks 1 to 4 gestation). Anencephaly is the complete absence of both cerebral hemispheres. Because the underlying mesoderm also fails to properly differentiate, a large cranial vault defect (in skull, meninges, and skin) also occurs. This is not compatible with life, and most such infants are stillborn; in rare cases in which the infant is born alive, death occurs soon after birth. Encephalocele is defined by herniation of neural tissues 1174 (hamartomatous brain tissue, without recognizable architecture) into a midline defect in the skull. Encephaloceles are most often located in the occipital area and less often in frontal areas. Clinically, they appear as round, protuberant, fluctuant masses covered by an opaque membrane or normal skin. They are compatible with life although they cause multiple complications. Associated clinical features include microcephaly, developmental delay (which is more severe in occipital as compared with frontal encephaloceles), and invariably hydrocephalus. Chromosomal aberrations commonly seen in patients with encephaloceles include trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. Occipital encephaloceles should be distinguished from cranial meningocele in which only leptomeninges and CSF are herniated through a skull defect. Spina bifida results from failure of fusion of the posterior neuropore. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "a",
      "explicacao": "This patient has phenylketonuria (PKU). This is a disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, and its deficiency leads to accumulation of phenylalanine, which is then metabolized by phenylalanine transaminase to phenylpyruvic acid, which is subsequently oxidized to phenylacetic acid, responsible for the musty odor of the sweat and urine of these patients. This condition is autosomal recessive. Patients with PKU are normal at birth, with a rise in the phenylalanine levels after initiation of feeding. These patients will have developmental delay, cognitive impairment, microcephaly, seizures, hypotonia, and severe behavioral disturbances. A musty odor, as described, is characteristic. These children are fair, with blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin given the lack of tyrosine and melanin pigment 1175 production. Children with PKU appear normal at birth, with normal neurodevelopment in early stages, but if untreated, severe intellectual impairment ensues. Despite treatment, some patients still have varying degrees of mild–moderate cognitive delays. Acute metabolic encephalopathy, common to inborn errors of metabolism, does not typically occur in patients with PKU. Newborn screening detects hyperphenylalaninemia, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of elevation of phenylalanine levels in blood. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase, and its deficiency may produce hyperphenylalaninemia (and PKU). A reduction of phenylalanine levels in blood and urine after a trial of tetrahydrobiopterin is used to make the diagnosis of this condition. The treatment of PKU is dietary restriction of phenylalanine, and these patients should be placed on a low-protein diet and phenylalanine-free feeding formula as soon as possible after birth, which will prevent neurologic deterioration. Tetrahydrobiopterin is used as a treatment adjunct in select patients. Piña-Garza JE. Fenichel’s Clinical Pediatric Neurology: A Signs and Symptoms Approach. 7th ed. London: Saunders Elsevier; 2013."

      "resposta_correta": "c",
      "explicacao": "This patient has maple syrup urine disease. This is an autosomal recessive condition caused by branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex deficiency, leading to the accumulation of branched amino acids and their ketoacids. The branched-chain amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are normally transaminated to α-ketoacids and subsequently catabolized by oxidative decarboxylation by branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Leucine, isoleucine, and valine are essential amino acids; accumulation of other essential amino acids does not play a role in this disease. There are three main phenotypes of this condition: a classic, an intermittent, and an intermediate form. The classic type is the most severe and presents in the neonatal period with lethargy, poor feeding, and hypotonia after ingestion of protein. At 2 to 3 days of 1176 life, a progressive encephalopathy develops with opisthotonus and abnormal movements. At around 1 week, these patients may have coma and respiratory failure, with subsequent cerebral edema and seizures, and eventually death if untreated. The intermediate form presents in late infancy with developmental delay, failure to thrive, ataxia, and seizures. There may be exacerbations with protein intake or intercurrent infections. Some cases are responsive to thiamine. In the intermittent form, patients are normal in between episodes, and alteration of consciousness and ataxia occur during intercurrent illness or in the presence of other stressors. These patients typically have urine with a maple syrup odor, which is more prominent during exacerbations. Diagnosis is made by detection of elevated levels of branched-chain amino acids and their ketoacids in blood and urine. Enzyme activity can be measured in fibroblasts and hepatocytes. Treatment is a low-protein diet, more specifically a branched- chain amino acid–restricted diet, which should be started early in life (as soon as the diagnosis is suspected) to prevent cognitive decline. Thiamine should be provided, since some patients may be responsive to this vitamin. Orthotopic liver transplantation may be a therapy for these patients. This condition is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment in most patients with the classic or severe form of the disease. Piña-Garza JE.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "Sacral agenesis is absence of the sacrum rather than absence of the sacral spinal cord and is frequently associated with other malformations. The NTDs include meningocele, myelomeningocele, diastematomyelia, diplomyelia, and sacral agenesis. Caudal NTDs result from failure of fusion of the posterior neuropore at day 26 of gestation (nervous system embryogenesis is further discussed in questions 1 to 3, 8, 16, and 19). Meningocele is isolated protrusion of the meninges into a bony 1177 defect within the vertebral column. This protrusion is typically covered by skin. It is not usually associated with neurologic deficits, and if neurologic deficit is found, myelomeningocele should be suspected. Myelomeningocele (also known as spinal dysraphism or rachischisis) is protrusion of potentially all layers of intraspinal contents through a bony defect: spinal cord, nerve roots, and meninges. The spinal cord may either be exposed, or a thin membrane may cover the protrusion. They most often occur in the lumbosacral region but can occur at any level. This is a clinically severe NTD associated with hydrocephalus, motor and sensory abnormalities of the legs, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Myelomeningocele occurs in association with Chiari II malformations (discussed in question 21). Diastematomyelia is splitting of the spinal cord into two portions by a midline septum. Diplomyelia is duplication of the spinal cord and is distinguished from diastematomyelia by the presence of two central canals each surrounded by gray and white matter as in a normal spinal cord. Sacral agenesis, or absence of the whole (or in some cases parts of the) sacrum, classically occurs in association with a variety of other urogenital, gastrointestinal, and spinal cord abnormalities. It has been associated with maternal insulin-dependent diabetes. Autosomal dominant forms associated with homeobox gene mutations have been identified. Clinical manifestations range from mild motor deficits to severe sensory and motor deficits and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Management of NTDs involves surgical approaches as well as management of complications including hydrocephalus and bowel and bladder dysfunction. A search for associated malformations in other organs (such as the heart or kidneys) should be pursued. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

      "explicacao": "Single or multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas occur in more than half of patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC, also discussed in questions 61 to 63). The majority of them regress over time, and they are often clinically irrelevant over the long term. In other patients with cardiac rhabdomyomas, manifestations may include heart failure due to obstruction or cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and stroke from cerebral embolization. Surveillance with periodic echocardiograms should occur in TSC patients with rhabdomyomas to ensure lack of enlargement and regression. Medical management of arrhythmias, heart failure, or surgical removal is necessary in some patients. Renal angiomyolipomas, benign tumors consisting of vessels, smooth muscle, and fat, occur in more than half of patients with TSC. They may be single or bilateral and multiple. Large lesions can cause hemorrhage and may need to be embolized endovascularly. Rapamycin may be useful in inhibiting their growth. Less commonly, renal cell carcinoma occurs. Renal cysts also occur in TSC; surveillance with periodic renal ultrasonography is recommended. Lymphangiomyomatosis is a rare, often fatal pulmonary disease occurring most often in female patients with TSC. It can lead to a variety of symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis. Pneumothorax may develop in some. Treatment may include progesterone or the estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, but this disease is often fatal a few years after onset. Patients with TSC, especially women, should undergo chest imaging if respiratory symptoms arise. In patients with TSC, several ophthalmologic manifestations may occur. Retinal hamartomas may be seen, ranging from subtle to classic mulberry-like lesions near the optic disc, and also including plaques or depigmented lesions. In some patients, when the lesion involves the macula, vision loss may occur. Other less common complications that may threaten vision in patients with TSC include retinal detachment or hemorrhage into the vitreous. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Propionic acidemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. This enzyme normally participates in the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to D- methylmalonyl-CoA, a step that requires the coenzyme biotin. Children with propionic acidemia appear normal at birth but will develop symptoms in the early neonatal period, in infancy, or later in childhood. Patients present with feeding difficulty, lethargy, hypotonia, dehydration, and attacks of metabolic acidosis with ketosis and hyperammonemia. They may progress to have seizures and coma. Other findings include hepatomegaly, pancytopenia, and bleeding disorders including intracranial hemorrhage. Patients who survive have developmental delay and involuntary movements (resulting from basal ganglia involvement). The diagnosis is suspected in newborn babies with ketoacidosis, with an anion gap, and elevated propionic acid levels in the blood and sometimes in the urine. There are also elevations of glycine in plasma and urine, and methylcitrate and β-hydroxypropionate in urine. Enzyme activity is reduced when tested in leukocytes and fibroblasts. Treatment involves restricting protein from the diet and providing parenteral fluids for hydration, as well as carnitine and biotin supplementation. Dialysis may be required in some patients. Antibiotics such as metronidazole may decrease the production of propionate by enteric bacteria. D-Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency causes methylmalonic acidemia (discussed in question 66) and not propionic acidemia. Propionic acidemia is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment in most patients with the classic or severe form of the disease. 1180 Piña-Garza JE.

It can often be asymptomatic, but an abnormal conus medullaris and filum terminale are possible. The presence of a tuft of hair, associated with underlying spina bifida occulta, does not necessarily imply impending cognitive or motor delay. In fact, when early neurologic development is normal, it will typically continue to be so. However, associated neurologic dysfunction may portend future neurologic impairment. When there is associated neurologic dysfunction in a child with a tuft of hair over the lumbar region but with no other evidence of NTD, the disorder is named occult spinal dysraphism. In occult spinal dysraphism, a variety of developmental abnormalities may be seen involving the spinal cord or roots and posterior fossa, and associated findings may include dermoid or epidermoid cysts, intraspinal or cutaneous lipomas, and tethered cord. Diastematomyelia, or splitting of the spinal cord, may also be seen. Rarely, a sinus tract connects the dura with the surface of the skin. In occult spinal dysraphism, neurologic manifestations vary widely and may range from minimal motor deficits and ankle hyporeflexia to bowel and bladder dysfunction, sensory loss, and paraparesis or paraplegia.

Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is encoded by the gene HPRT1 on chromosome Xq26, and deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of purines with their subsequent conversion to uric acid. There is a spectrum of the disease, ranging from the classic Lesch–Nyhan syndrome to milder forms without neurologic manifestations. The classic form may manifest in the newborn period with severe hypotonia. These children will have delayed motor development, progressive limb and neck rigidity with dystonia, choreoathetotic movements, facial grimacing, seizures, spasticity, and intellectual impairment. Aggressive behavior, self- mutilation, and progressive dementia are hallmarks of the neurologic form of the disease.

      "explicacao": "This patient has Niemann–Pick type C, which is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in intracellular cholesterol circulation, resulting in lysosomal storage of phospholipids and glycolipids, with alteration in glycolipid metabolism. Normally, cholesterol is hydrolyzed in lysosomes and later transported to the plasma membrane; in Niemann-Pick type C, however, there is a problem in cholesterol transport and it, therefore, accumulates in perinuclear lysosomes. The abnormal gene is NPC1 located on chromosome 18q11. The onset of this disorder ranges from the neonatal period, through infancy, childhood, adolescence, and even adulthood. Patients with early-onset disease have visceromegaly and hepatic dysfunction in the first year of life and neurologic deterioration between 1 and 3 years of age, with manifestations such as ataxia, vertical gaze apraxia, and intellectual impairment. Patients with delayed-onset forms have normal initial development, subsequently manifesting ataxia, and oculomotor abnormalities, especially vertical gaze apraxia, spasticity, seizures, and progressive 1184 neurologic deterioration with cognitive impairment. Late-onset disease has a much slower course. Pathologically, there is visceral accumulation of lipids and foamy histiocytes with membrane-bound lamellar structures and lucent vacuoles. Neuronal ballooning is also seen, as well as meganeurites, and eventually neuronal loss associated with cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Diagnosis is achieved with the Filipin test, which demonstrates impaired ability of cultured fibroblasts to esterify cholesterol. Unesterified cholesterol accumulates in perinuclear lysosomes, and this is detected by the fluorescent stain Filipin. Treatment is supportive.

      "explicacao": "Prenatal ultrasonography is used in detecting NTDs and characterizing them. Prenatally, in the setting of most NTDs, serum maternal α-fetoprotein level is elevated. α-Fetoprotein is a normal component of fetal CSF, and leakage into the amniotic fluid from an open neural tube leads to elevated amniotic α-fetoprotein. The level of elevation correlates with the severity of the NTD. Elevations in amniotic fluid acetylcholinesterase levels also occur and, combined with an elevated α-fetoprotein, increase sensitivity and specificity in prenatal screening. As mentioned, ultrasonography can also be used to detect NTDs and characterize them. Prenatal MRI is also done in some cases to assess the extent of the abnormality, aiding in prognostication of neurologic function in life. When an NTD is detected with screening, and/or other abnormalities are found on ultrasonography, fetal karyotyping to assess for trisomy 13, 18, and others may be 1185 obtained to further assist in the diagnosis.

      "explicacao": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A with accumulation of sulfatide, resulting in demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system. Clinically there are three forms: a late infantile form with onset between 6 months and 2 years (most common), a juvenile form with onset between 3 and 16 years, and an adult form with onset after 16 years of age. The infantile form manifests with clumsiness, frequent falls, and slurred speech, and is associated with weakness and hypotonia. With progression of the disease, these children have motor regression and upper motor neuron signs. They have loss of vision and hearing, peripheral neuropathy, and progressive deterioration of mental function to a vegetative state and death. The juvenile form has a slower progression. The adult form presents with behavioral changes, psychosis, and dementia. Magnetic resonance image demonstrates T2 hyperintense signal changes in periventricular and subcortical white matter, sparing the U fibers. Cerebellar white matter is also involved. Pathologically, there are confluent symmetric lesions in the white matter and later atrophy. Central and peripheral demyelination is seen, with accumulation of metachromatic material in macrophages. Nerve conduction velocities are initially normal, but slowing is seen later in the course. Most cases are caused by mutations in the arylsulfatase A gene, with a minority of patients carrying mutations in the prosaposin gene ( PSAP gene), leading to deficiency of a sphingolipid activator protein (SAP-B or saposin B) that normally stimulates the degradation of sulfatides by arylsulfatase A. Arylsulfatase A is responsible for the breakdown of cerebroside sulfate (a major myelin glycoprotein). Its decreased activity leads to accumulation of cerebroside sulfate in the central and peripheral nervous 1186 systems, kidneys, and other organs. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of typical MRI findings and confirmed by demonstrating deficiency of arylsulfatase A in leukocytes and/or fibroblasts. Treatment is supportive.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "While syringomyelia and hydromyelia are erroneously used interchangeably by some, the two are distinct by definition. Syringomyelia is a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord that is separate from the central canal and lined by gliotic tissue; hydromyelia is the term used to describe an enlargement in the central canal itself, and the cavity wall is, therefore, lined by ependyma. Chiari I malformation is defined as displacement of the cerebellum and cerebellar tonsils downward through the foramen magnum. Figure 14.1 depicts a Chiari I malformation with 1.3-cm downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils. In minor downward displacement of less than 1 cm, the patient may be asymptomatic, and care should be taken in attributing nonspecific neurologic symptoms to the Chiari malformation. In more severe downward displacement, as in this case, headache, ataxia, nystagmus, cranial nerve abnormalities, and other brainstem symptoms may occur. Associated findings include syringomyelia. The pathophysiology of Chiari I malformation may relate to posterior fossa overcrowding due to posterior fossa hypoplasia. In 1187 symptomatic cases, treatment includes posterior fossa decompression and duraplasty. Chiari II malformation, also known as Arnold–Chiari malformation, includes displacement of the cerebellar vermis and tonsils in association with a myelomeningocele. Brainstem dysfunction is often prominent, including cranial nerve abnormalities, stridor, apnea, and feeding difficulties. Fourth ventricle compression leads to hydrocephalus. The exact cause of Chiari II is not known; however, a theory suggests that Chiari II malformation may be secondary to the presence of the caudal myelomeningocele, producing downward traction and hence herniation of the brainstem and cerebellum through the foramen magnum. Management of Chiari II malformation includes shunting for hydrocephalus and surgical intervention for the myelomeningocele. Treatment may include posterior fossa decompression through suboccipital craniectomy. Management of complications including seizures, feeding difficulties, and bowel and bladder dysfunction is also necessary. Chiari III malformation is cerebellar herniation into a cervical or occipital encephalocele. Chiari IV malformation is the term previously used to describe cerebellar hypoplasia but is no longer used. Swaiman KF, Ashwal S, Ferriero DM, et al.

      "explicacao": "Sialidosis belongs to the group of glycoproteinoses, and myoclonic epilepsy is seen in these patients. Glycoproteinoses are a group of lysosomal storage disorders of autosomal recessive inheritance, in which the enzymatic defect leads to accumulation of oligosaccharides, glycopeptides, and glycolipids. Accumulation in the brain and viscera leads to vacuolization of multiple cell types. There are multiple phenotypes depending on the enzyme affected. In general, these patients have coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and psychomotor retardation. 1188 Sialidosis is caused by deficiency of lysosomal α-N-acetyl neuraminidase (sialidase), leading to increased urinary excretion of sialic acid–containing oligosaccharides. Type I sialidosis (cherry-red spot myoclonus syndrome) has its onset in adolescence to adulthood and manifests with myoclonic epilepsy, visual deterioration, and cherry-red spots without dysmorphism. Type II is the childhood form, and these patients have not only myoclonic epilepsy and cherry-red spots in the retina but also severe neurologic abnormalities, coarse facial features, severe dysostosis, and psychomotor retardation. The neonatal form is characterized by hydrops fetalis, nephrotic syndrome, and early death. Other glycoproteinoses include α-mannosidosis caused by α- mannosidase deficiency, β-mannosidosis caused by β-mannosidase deficiency, fucosidosis caused by α-fucosidase deficiency, aspartylglucosaminuria caused by aspartylglucosaminidase deficiency, and Schindler’s disease caused by α-N- acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. Abnormal urinary excretion of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides, as well as vacuolated lymphocytes with membrane- bound vacuoles, can be seen.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "The less severe forms of holoprosencephaly may be compatible with life with few neurologic deficits. During embryologic development, after fusion of the anterior neuropore, vesicles form and ultimately give rise to different brain structures. The prosencephalon vesicle gives rise to the telencephalon. The telencephalon divides to give the two cerebral hemispheres and the basal ganglia. The prosencephalon also gives rise to the diencephalon, from which the thalamus and the hypothalamus originate. The mesoderm of the notochord provides signals for this differentiation; one such signaling molecule is the sonic hedgehog protein. Abnormalities of this stage of development, which is typically completed by the fifth gestational week, lead to a variety of midline brain and face malformations. Failure of the prosencephalon to form the telencephalon and diencephalon, and failure of formation of two distinct cerebral hemispheres, results in the malformation known as holoprosencephaly. In alobar holoprosencephaly (most severe), the 1191 cerebral hemispheres are almost completely fused, with absence of the interhemispheric fissure and corpus callosum. There is a single midline ventricle. Variable dysgenesis and fusion of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and basal ganglia is present. In semilobar holoprosencephaly, parts of the posterior hemispheres may be separated by a fissure. In lobar holoprosencephaly, only the most anterior portions of the hemispheres are not separated, and there is partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, but the splenium and genu are present. The olfactory bulb and tracts develop from the prosencephalon a few days after the hemispheres divide. In severe forms of holoprosencephaly, arrhinencephaly (agenesis of the olfactory bulb and tract) invariably occurs. However, in less severe forms of holoprosencephaly, arrhinencephaly may occur in isolation. Kallmann’s syndrome, an X-linked dominant disorder, is characterized by anosmia (due to arrhinencephaly) and hypogonadism. In infants with alobar holoprosencephaly, associated midline facial defects such as cyclopia (single midline eye) and proboscis (single-nostril nose) often occur, and these more severely affected individuals are usually stillborn or do not survive long after birth. If death does not occur in utero, the clinical picture includes severe cognitive and motor delay, feeding difficulties, and seizures. Endocrinologic problems including diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism are frequent. Hydrocephalus is a frequent complication. In less severe forms such as in isolated arrhinencephaly, little neurologic dysfunction may be clinically apparent. Chromosomal aberrations associated with holoprosencephaly include trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. Autosomal recessive and dominant forms, due to mutations in the sonic hedgehog gene and other genes, exist. In addition to a variety of genetic and environmental mechanisms, the pathophysiology of holoprosencephaly also relates to abnormal cholesterol metabolism, as cholesterol influences sonic hedgehog protein function. Hence, holoprosencephaly has an association with the cholesterol synthesis disorder Smith-Lemli-Opitz, which results from a defect in 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the enzyme that 1192 catalyzes the final step in cholesterol synthesis.

Mutations in several genes causing the disorder ( CLN1 through CLN10 ) have been described. The most commonly involved genes are CLN1 and CLN2. CLN1 encodes for palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), and CLN2 encodes for tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). The storage products are saposins A and D in the infantile forms and subunit C of ATP synthase in the other forms. The infantile form is most common in Finland and is associated with CLN1 gene mutations. These patients are normal at birth, with onset of symptoms between 6 and 24 months, including microcephaly, hypotonia, myoclonus, seizures, ataxia, progressive psychomotor retardation, and blindness. Neurons accumulate membrane-bound granular osmiophilic deposits (seen on electron microscopy), and neuronal loss with cortical atrophy will ensue. The late-infantile form presents between 2 and 4 years of age and is associated with CLN2 mutations, and these patients develop seizures, myoclonus, ataxia, involuntary movements, blindness, and psychomotor retardation. Neurons accumulate curvilinear bodies, which are seen on electron microscopy. Late-infantile form variants have also been described with mutations in CLN5, CLN6, and CLN8. The juvenile form begins between 4 and 10 years of age and is associated with CLN3 mutation, and these patients develop visual loss, seizures, myoclonus, psychomotor retardation, and focal neurologic deficits. The storage product that accumulates in this 1193 form consists of fingerprint bodies, which are seen by electron microscopy. The adult form is evident at around 30 years of age and is characterized by cognitive and behavioral disturbances; dementia ensues. Ataxia may also occur. In the late stages of the disease, extrapyramidal symptoms are present, especially facial dyskinesias. Some patients may develop myoclonic seizures as well. Visual failure does not occur in the adult form. The storage material that accumulates with this form consists of a combination of fingerprint bodies, rectilinear profiles and granular osmiophilic deposits. The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and supported with electron microscopic examination of lymphocytes or cells from other tissues. Enzyme activity studies for PPT1 and TPP1 are also available, as is genetic testing for the CLN genes. The treatment is symptomatic. Prayson RA.

      "explicacao": "The history and diagnostic studies including elevation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) suggest Zellweger’s syndrome, a peroxisomal disorder in which the white matter is involved. Peroxisomes are organelles involved in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids and bile acids, oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, prostaglandins, and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, and the catabolism of phytanate, pipecolate, and glycolate. The infantile syndromes of peroxisomal dysfunction include Zellweger’s syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum’s disease. Zellweger’s syndrome is the most severe form and is caused by mutations in the PEX genes, the majority with PEX1 resulting in abnormal peroxisomal biogenesis. Zellweger’s syndrome has been called “cerebrohepatorenal syndrome” and is characterized by dysmorphic features such as a high forehead, large fontanelles, flat supraorbital ridges, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, micrognathia, and flat occiput. These children have cataracts, retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, severe hypotonia, decreased sucking and crying, hyporeflexia, deformities in flexion of the lower limbs with arthrogryposis, profound intellectual impairment, and seizures. The brain demonstrates white matter changes and abnormalities in neuronal migration. There is liver dysfunction 1195 with cirrhosis and polycystic kidney disease. A typical feature is chondrodysplasia punctata with bony stippling of the patella. Other congenital abnormalities have been reported, such as ventricular septal defects and other cardiac abnormalities. Diagnostic workup demonstrates increased plasma very long- chain fatty acids, decreased red blood cell plasmalogens, and decreased or absent hepatic peroxisomes. Pathologically, the brain may be enlarged, and there is evidence of neuronal migration abnormalities such as pachygyria and/or polymicrogyria, as well as white matter changes with lipid accumulation. The treatment of Zellweger’s syndrome is symptomatic. Most of these patients die early. The other peroxisomal disorders are milder. Patients with neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy have liver cirrhosis, adrenocortical atrophy, and brain abnormalities such as polymicrogyria, subcortical heterotopia, and cerebellar dysplasia but no pachygyria. Infantile Refsum’s disease manifests with psychomotor retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, retinal degeneration, anosmia, and mild dysmorphic features. There may be cirrhosis and adrenal atrophy. In Refsum’s disease, phytanic acid levels are elevated and peroxisomes are reduced or absent. These patients may survive into adulthood. Piña-Garza JE.

      "explicacao": "Fabry’s disease is an X-linked disorder that results from a mutation in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase. Multiple organs are involved; renal involvement leads to renal failure and cardiac involvement to cardiomyopathy. Cutaneous manifestations in Fabry’s disease include purplish angiokeratomas 1196 often occurring in the groin, hips, periumbilical region, and lower extremities. Neurologic manifestations involve both the peripheral nervous system (including small fiber neuropathy with attacks of cold-induced painful paresthesias in the extremities, acroparesthesias) and the CNS. Central nervous system manifestations include stroke and other vascular events related to vascular ectasia, with often marked dolichoectatic enlargement of the basilar artery. Fabry’s disease is also discussed in question 24. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder in which telangiectasia occurs in the skin, mucous membranes, and several organs including the retina and the gastrointestinal tract. Recurrent epistaxis is a common manifestation. Central nervous system involvement results from single or multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or cerebral embolism associated with pulmonary AVMs. It results from a mutation in the HHT1 gene on chromosome 9 that encodes for endoglin, a protein that binds transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), or from a mutation in the HHT2 gene on chromosome 12. Wyburn–Mason syndrome is another neurocutaneous disorder in which multiple AVMs occur on the face, in the retina, and intracranially. In pseudoxanthoma elasticum (Gronblad–Strandberg syndrome), a connective tissue disorder that may be autosomal dominant or recessive, yellowish xanthomas occur in various skin regions and mucous membranes. Pigmentary changes in the retina result in a peu d’orange (orange skin) appearance and angioid streaks develop, which do not affect the vision directly, but due to weakening of retinal vessels, hemorrhages may occur. Neurologic manifestations relate to vascular occlusions and intracranial carotid artery aneurysms. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome exists in at least 10 subtypes, with types I, II, and III being the most common. These subtypes share the occurrence of hyperelastic skin, hyperextensible joints, and vascular lesions. This syndrome results from mutations in various genes encoding for different types of collagen. The main neurologic significance of this disorder is the increased risk of intracranial aneurysms, carotid-cavernous fistulas (that may be spontaneous or due to mild trauma), and arterial dissection. 1197 Xeroderma pigmentosum is a neurocutaneous disorder marked by sensitivity to ultraviolet light that predisposes affected individuals to skin freckling and multiple cutaneous malignancies including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma as well as other cutaneous and systemic tumors. Neurologic abnormalities include progressive cognitive dysfunction, hearing loss, tremor, chorea, and ataxia as well as peripheral neuropathy. Xeroderma pigmentosum is autosomal recessive associated with mutations on chromosome 9 that result in abnormal DNA repair. Cockayne’s syndrome is a related disorder. Another disorder of DNA repair associated with neurologic features is ataxia telangiectasia (discussed in Chapter 6 ). Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Arrhinencephaly (agenesis of only the olfactory bulb and tract) and/or hypothalamic hamartomas may be associated features. Other less commonly associated abnormalities include cerebellar vermis defects and hydrocephalus. Septo-optic dysplasia can also be associated with lobar holoprosencephaly and other malformations of cortical development. Clinical manifestations include vision loss, ataxia when the cerebellum is involved, symptoms of hydrocephalus when it is present, and endocrinologic disturbances that can range from panhypopituitarism to isolated hormone deficiencies. Mutations in the transcription factors HESX1, homeobox, and SOX genes may be implicated in this disorder. 1198 Cavum septum pellucidum, in which the septum pellucidum is not fused, is considered nonpathologic, with little clinical implications.

      "explicacao": "Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes for a peroxisomal membrane transporter (ATP-binding cassette [ABC] transporter superfamily), resulting in impaired transport of very long chain fatty acids into peroxisomes, preventing beta-oxidation with subsequent accumulation in tissue and plasma. There are 3 phenotypes: childhood onset cerebral type, adrenomyeloneuropathy, and pure adrenal insufficiency. Female carriers may have mild symptoms of adrenomyeloneuropathy. The childhood onset cerebral form starts between 4 and 8 years of age, with behavioral changes that may be misdiagnosed as attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity; the disease progresses into cognitive impairment, spasticity, disturbances of gait, and incoordination. Bulbar dysfunction is often prominent and patients may require G-tube placement. Life-threatening adrenal insufficiency may occur and adrenal function should be monitored. The prognosis is poor and these patients die early. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates confluent T2 hyperintensities (hypointense on T1) in the white matter affecting predominantly the parieto-occipital regions and the posterior corpus callosum. These areas may display a rim of enhancement that helps differentiate from other white matter diseases (except Alexander’s disease which shows significant contrast enhancement on MRI). Pathologically, there is symmetric and confluent demyelination 1199 affecting initially the posterior regions and sparing the U fibers. There is involvement of other tissues, including the adrenal cortex and Leydig cells of the testis. Histopathologically, cerebral lesions are characterized by the presence of perivascular cuffing, with predominance of T cells. Adrenomyeloneuropathy is the most common phenotype and manifests with slowly progressive paraparesis that begins after 20 years of age, sensory neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, and sphincter control abnormalities. Brain abnormalities may be seen in some of these patients and a subset develop cognitive impairment. Although less frequent than with the childhood onset cerebral type, adrenal insufficiency also occurs and adrenal function should be monitored. Pathologically, there is long tract degeneration with axon and myelin loss. Peripheral nerve demyelination without inflammation also occurs. The third type is isolated adrenal insufficiency. Rarely, patients with adrenoleukodystrophy may present with Addisonian crisis. Patients with adrenoleukodystrophy have increased plasma levels of very long-chain fatty acids, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is increased secondary to adrenal insufficiency. Treatment involves supportive care with steroid replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency. “Lorenzo’s oil,” which consists of 4:1 glyceryl trioleate-glyceryl trierucate, has been shown to reduce levels of very long-chain fatty acids in plasma. Dietary use of Lorenzo’s oil may be beneficial in young asymptomatic patients but not in patients with neurologic deficits. Bone marrow transplantation may have a role in early stages of the disease.

It may be sporadic or familial, with only some cases with the typical maternal inheritance pattern, and may result from mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA encoding for different subunits of the respiratory chain. This condition affects neurons of the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Most affected patients have onset of neurologic manifestations in the first year of life, but there are forms with late onset. Clinical features manifest with decompensation associated with intercurrent illnesses. In infancy, patients present with hypotonia, loss of head control, poor sucking, vomiting, irritability, seizures, and myoclonic jerks. If the onset is beyond the first year, patients present with gait disturbance, cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, psychomotor retardation, spasticity, external ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, abnormal movements with chorea or dystonias, peripheral neuropathy, and, in some cases, with autonomic failure. Respiratory involvement is often present, with manifestations such as apnea, sighing, periodic hyperventilation, and irregular breathing. Respiratory failure may lead to death. The disorder is progressive with episodic deterioration. Lactate level is increased in blood and CSF. Lactate and pyruvate levels in blood are elevated during exacerbations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrates bilateral symmetric hyperintense T2 signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia as well as other regions including the substantia nigra, inferior olivary nuclei, periaqueductal gray matter, corpus callosum, and, in some cases, the spinal cord.

These disorders affect multiple organ systems, especially the CNS. There is a wide variety of manifestations, although developmental delay and liver involvement are common to most forms. The defect 1202 is abnormal synthesis, modification, transport, and/or processing of the carbohydrate moieties or glycans of glycoproteins, therefore, affecting protein components in many tissues. These disorders have been previously classified into type I and type II, each with several subtypes. The nomenclature and classification is evolving and complex and is outside the scope of this text. Type I CDGs are caused by abnormal synthesis of glycans. Congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ia (also known by the gene as PMM2-CDG) are the best described subtype and to date, reported as the most frequently encountered. Patients with PMM2- CDG manifest with failure to thrive, developmental delay, cerebellar atrophy, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, ataxia, weakness, retinitis pigmentosa, short stature with skeletal abnormalities, polyneuropathy, stroke-like episodes, liver dysfunction, hypogonadism, and multisystem involvement. Lipodystrophy with prominent fat pads in the buttocks and suprapubic area, as well as inverted nipples, is distinctive. Type II CDGs are caused by abnormal processing and modification of glycans and lead to profound intellectual impairment but no cerebellar ataxia or peripheral neuropathy. Congenital disorders of glycosylation are characterized by the presence of a carbohydrate-deficient transferrin in the serum and CSF, and these conditions are diagnosed on the basis of serum transferrin isoforms. Genetic confirmation is available for some subtypes. Treatment is supportive. Piña-Garza JE. Fenichel’s Clinical Pediatric Neurology: A Signs and Symptoms Approach. 7th ed.

      "explicacao": "The cerebral hemispheres form from an initially single layer of epithelium located in the region surrounding the lateral ventricles known as the ventricular zone. Cells in this layer are pluripotential and frequently divide, and are radially oriented, in contact with the pial surface and with the ventricle. Several layers form subsequently. By the fifth gestational week, a marginal layer forms superficial to the ventricular zone, containing mostly cytoplasmic processes from the ventricular zone. Another layer, the subventricular zone, forms in between superficial to the ventricular zone. The subventricular zone and the ventricular zone contain mitotic cells. Specialized cells known as radial glia have cell bodies in the ventricular zone and send process that extend all the way to the pial membrane in the cortical surface. During cortical development, new neurons migrate in waves from the zone of origin and along a scaffold formed by the radial glial processes. One wave of migration starts at approximately 8 weeks of 1204 gestation and the other at 12 weeks of gestation. The peak of neuronal migration is between 12 and 20 weeks of gestation but can be seen up to 26 weeks. The cortex develops “inside-out,” such that cells in the earliest portion of migration form deeper layers, whereas cells that migrate later form more superficial structures. Studies have found that ventricular zone radial glia cells are primitive pluripotential cells that can initially divide and generate radial glia cells and immature neurons, which would eventually migrate along the radial glia to the cortical plate. Neuronal progenitor cells (immature progenitor cells and nonepithelial radial glia-like cells) are found in the ventricular and subventricular zones, which can divide and produce immature neurons. Several factors influence neurogenesis (formation of neurons, including pyramidal neurons, cortical granular or stellate neurons, Betz cells, and others) and gliogenesis (formation of glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependyma, and microglia), as well as cell migration. These include regulatory proteins, transcription factors, and neurotransmitters, each varying with the stage of development. Cajal–Retzius cells are a group of pioneer neurons found in the marginal zone. These cells express Reelin and other proteins necessary for neuronal migration along radial glia and cortical organization and lamination. All six layers of the cortex are identifiable by 27 weeks of gestation. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012.

The phakomatoses are a group of disorders that share in common the occurrence of dysplastic lesions and the tendency for tumor formation. They include neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, 1205 Sturge–Weber syndrome (SWS), epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS), and HI, in addition to a variety of other rare disorders, some of which are discussed briefly later. In incontinentia pigmenti, skin involvement occurs in stages including vesiculobullous lesions present at birth, verrucous lesions that appear at approximately 6 weeks of age, and then hyperpigmented lesions that follow the Blaschko lines (lines of skin development). Hyperpigmentation decreases over time, with tendency to disappear or become hypopigmented and atretic later in life. Some patients have normal cognition and no evidence of neurologic dysfunction; neurologic manifestations include intellectual impairment, pyramidal tract findings, and ocular abnormalities. It is X-linked dominant in inheritance and affects only females; it is thought to be lethal in males. It results from a mutation in the NEMO gene, which encodes a protein involved in the nuclear factor κ B pathway. Neurocutaneous melanosis is characterized by the presence of various types of congenital cutaneous lesions that are abnormally pigmented (such as giant hair pigmented nevi and congenital melanocytic nevi) in association with leptomeningeal melanosis. The leptomeningeal areas most often affected include those around the base of the brain, brainstem, and cerebellum. Hydrocephalus is a common complication. The pathophysiology of this disorder is not well defined; the cells of origin of the leptomeningeal melanosis are thought to be melanoblasts, pigmented cells normally found in the pia mater. There is high risk of developing a melanoma. Parry–Romberg syndrome is characterized by progressive loss of facial tissue, cartilage, and bone, leading to hemifacial atrophy, often with ipsilateral loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair. This begins typically in early childhood and the atrophy progression ceases by the third decade of life. Neurologic manifestations include headaches, Horner’s syndrome, seizures, and hemiparesis. Patients with Parry–Romberg syndrome are at increased risk of a variety of benign tumors. The disorder must be distinguished from scleroderma and lipodystrophy. In Maffucci’s syndrome, multiple enchondromas (tumors of cartilage) occur in association with secondary hemangioma 1206 formation and various skin findings, including vitiligo, hyperpigmented patches and nevi, and café-au-lait spots. These enchondromas grow over time, leading to disfigurement and skeletal abnormalities. Twenty to thirty percent of enchondromas may develop sarcomatous changes. Neurologic manifestations result from the association of this syndrome with various CNS tumors, including pituitary and brainstem tumors and other gliomas. Compression of nervous system structures by the enchondromas, such as cerebral compression by calvarial enchondromas, may also occur. In Von Hippel–Lindau disease, multiple retinal, cerebellar, and spinal hemangioblastomas occur. Benign hemangiomas and cysts in various body parts can also occur. Renal cell carcinoma causes significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Cutaneous manifestations are not a feature of this disorder. This disorder is autosomal dominant and results from a mutation in a gene ( VHL ) on chromosome 3 that encodes for a tumor suppressor protein. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "Periventricular nodular heterotopia is a disorder of neuronal migration. This disorder is characterized by nodules of gray matter lining the ventricles and extending to the lumen. The most common presentation is seizures, and patients often have learning disabilities. Developmental delay and other malformations can be seen. Malformations of cortical development are divided into four categories on the basis of the underlying cause: disorders of cell proliferation, migration, cortical organization, and malformations of cortical development not otherwise classified. Disorders of neuronal proliferation include some forms of megalencephaly (see questions 39 and 40) and focal cortical dysplasia. Disorders of 1207 neuronal migration include lissencephaly (agyria, pachygyria, and subcortical band heterotopia), cobblestone complex malformations, and all types of heterotopia, including periventricular nodular heterotopia. Disorders of cortical organization include polymicrogyria, focal cortical dysplasia with normal cell types, microdysgenesis, and schizencephaly. Focal cortical dysplasia includes a wide variety of cortical malformations in which there are abnormal cells (dysmorphic, enlarged neurons, balloon cells) and abnormal lamination. Focal cortical dysplasia may be seen in isolation or in the setting of tuberous sclerosis. One type of focal cortical dysplasia is characterized pathologically by the presence of balloon cells, which result from proliferation of abnormal cells within the germinal matrix. This is a common pathology in focal epilepsy, with seizures often being intractable to medical therapy. Swaiman KF, Ashwal S, Ferriero DM, et al.

Abnormalities of head size in childhood can be a clue to underlying CNS abnormalities. Microcephaly is defined as head circumference more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. A variety of causes of microcephaly exist. It can be a normal variant that is often hereditary, without clinical implications. When pathologic, causes include in utero infections, toxin exposure (such as alcohol, tobacco, and prescription drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents and antiepileptic drugs), hypoxic– ischemic injury, birth trauma, and metabolic disorders such as prolonged hypoglycemia. A wide variety of hereditary disorders including enzyme deficiencies can lead to microcephaly, as can chromosomal abnormalities. Clinical manifestations depend on the underlying cause and can range from none (asymptomatic 1208 microcephaly) to severe developmental delay and seizures. Macrocephaly is defined as a head circumference greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. Macrocephaly may be a normal variant that is often hereditary, may result from increased CSF, as in hydrocephalus due to a variety of causes, from mass lesions such as tumors or subdural hematomas, or may result from megalencephaly, an oversized brain (brain weight >2 standard deviations above the mean). Causes of megalencephaly include metabolic disorders including storage diseases such as mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) or Tay–Sachs disease, Canavan’s disease, Alexander’s disease, and other genetic disorders such as Sotos syndrome. Megalencephaly may also be a benign familial trait. Clinical manifestations depend on the underlying cause. Neurologic deficits may be absent in the benign familial form. Hemimegalencephaly, or enlargement of only one brain hemisphere, as depicted in Figure 14.3 , is a brain malformation with hamartomatous growth of a cerebral hemisphere (partially or totally) and frequently associated with cortical malformations. It is considered an abnormality of neuronal proliferation. Patients present with macrocephaly with cranial asymmetry, epilepsy, developmental delay, and hemiparesis contralateral to the hemimegalencephaly. These patients may benefit from hemispherectomy.

      "explicacao": "The history and imaging findings depicted in question 41 are consistent with Miller–Dieker syndrome (MDS), a form of lissencephaly, more specific a four-layer lissencephaly or classic lissencephaly. In lissencephaly, the cortex is smooth and may be thick but consists of only four layers or less. Lissencephaly is a malformation of cortical development from abnormal neuronal migration resulting in impaired formation of 1209 gyri. It is characterized by the presence of reduced cortical gyration and, in the most severe form, no gyri, or agyria, resulting in a smooth brain. In classic lissencephaly, the cortex is thick but consists of only four layers (or less, often two or three layers, as opposed to the normal six neocortical layers). Formerly, lissencephaly was classified in two groups, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 included MDS and but applied also for other variants. Type 2 consisted of the cobblestone lissencephalies (discussed in question 49). A newer classification groups lissencephalies into lissencephaly variants 4,3,2 layers (according to the number of layers, in which MDS or classic lissencephaly is included as a four-layer variant), cobblestone cortical malformation (discussed in question 49), microlissencephaly spectrum, and other lissencephalies. Miller–Dieker syndrome (four-layer variant, formerly a lissencephaly type 1) is characterized by lissencephaly associated with microcephaly, typical facies including micrognathia (small jaw), low-set ears, thin upper lip, short nose with upturned nares, prominent forehead, bitemporal hollowing, and other features. Clinical manifestations include global developmental delay, hypotonia and later spasticity, and intractable seizures. Life expectancy is often short. Miller–Dieker syndrome has been associated with microdeletions on chromosome 17 in the LIS1 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in regulation of microtubules and dynein function, and mutations interfere with microtubule- directed migration of neurons from the ventricular zone. Mutations in LIS1 gene can also lead to isolated lissencephaly (so-called isolated lissencephaly sequence, without other features of MDS). X-linked lissencephaly results from mutations in the DCX gene on chromosome X when occurring in males. This gene encodes for the protein doublecortin, which is involved in microtubule organization and stabilization. X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia in male patients is attributed to ARX gene mutation. This gene encodes for a transcription factor involved in nonradial migration of cortical interneurons, and patients with lissencephaly secondary to ARX mutation may have abnormalities in the basal ganglia in addition 1210 to the cortex and corpus callosum. In some forms of lissencephaly, there may be an anterior to posterior (or vice versa) gradient of gyral formation (e.g., with some gyral formation in the anterior or posterior aspects of the brain). Several associated malformations may be seen in patients with lissencephalies, including agenesis of the corpus callosum or hypoplasia of the cerebellum. Cobblestone cortical malformation (formerly known as lissencephaly type 2) is seen in several disorders including Walker– Warburg syndrome, Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, and muscle– eye–brain disease of Santavuori (discussed in question 49). In polymicrogyria, there are excess, abnormal gyri (discussed in question 56). Subcortical band heterotopia is discussed in questions 44 and 45. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

The cutaneous features of HI include multiple hypopigmented streaks or patches that are present at birth and in some follow Blaschko lines (skin lines that form specific patterns over the trunk and extremities, such as a V shape over the back and linear lines over the limbs). These lesions are either present at birth or emerge in infancy and are best detected under ultraviolet light in light-skinned children. The extent of the skin lesions does not correlate strongly with neurologic involvement. Neurologic manifestations include intellectual impairment that is 1211 seen in some but not all patients and can be severe. Seizures are the other main neurologic manifestation. Macrocephaly or microcephaly may be seen, with the former being more common. Cerebral hypoplasia and cerebellar hypoplasia are also often seen, and various malformations of cortical development may occur in patients with HI, including hemimegalencephaly and lissencephaly. White matter abnormalities are often present. Other manifestations of HI include eye involvement (commonly, with a variety of findings including microphthalmia, cataracts, optic atrophy, and retinal detachment), skeletal hemihypertrophy, cleft lip and palate, and congenital heart disease such as tetralogy of Fallot. Various karyotype abnormalities have been found in patients with HI, including mosaicism for aneuploidy or unbalanced translocations, mosaic trisomy 18, ring chromosome 22, and translocations involving the X chromosome.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "The disorder depicted is subcortical band heterotopia, a malformation of cortical development, more specifically a neuronal migration disorder (not a disorder of cortical organization). The lissencephaly syndromes result from neuronal migration abnormalities and include subcortical band heterotopia, or double cortex, in which there is relatively normal cortex (with six layers) 1212 with an underlying band of white matter, underneath which is a band of gray matter (as shown in Fig. 14.4 ). This disorder results from a mutation in the DCX gene on chromosome X in females. DCX encodes for the protein doublecortin, which is involved in microtubule organization and stabilization. The same mutation can lead to classic lissencephaly (smooth brain, agyria, or pachygyria) when occurring in males. This difference in manifestations in females as compared with males is thought to result from lyonization (random X inactivation) in females (XX), such that normal migration cannot occur in neurons in which the mutated gene is not compensated by the normal homologous copy, and neurons with normal copy of the gene can migrate to the cortex, resulting in a double cortical band. Subcortical band heterotopia can also occur in some patients with mosaic mutations of LIS1. Clinical features in patients with subcortical band heterotopia include intractable seizures, intellectual impairment and other neurologic deficits. Miller–Dieker syndrome is discussed in questions 41 and 42; it is characterized by agyria or pachygyria rather than the presence of two bands of gray matter separated by a band of white matter. Cobblestone lissencephaly (rather than subcortical band heterotopia), formerly known as lissencephaly type 2, is seen in several disorders, including Walker–Warburg syndrome, Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, and muscle–eye–brain disease of Santavuori (discussed in question 49).

NF1 is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder caused by a mutation in the neurofibromin ( NF1 ) gene located in chromosome 17q11.2. NF1 affects multiple organs including the skin, brain, eyes, peripheral nerves, kidneys, and bones. Figure 14.5 depicts hyperpigmented macules known as café au lait spots. Figure 14.6 depicts cutaneous neurofibromas, and Figure 14.7 depicts axillary freckling. The patients depicted in questions 46 and 48 meet diagnostic criteria for NF1. In order for a diagnosis of NF1 to be made, two or more of the following must be present: six or more café au lait macules (>5 mm in diameter in prepuberty or >15 mm in diameter in postpuberty), inguinal or axillary freckling (as shown in Fig. 14.7 ), two or more cutaneous neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma (see question 54), two or more Lisch’s nodules (iris hamartomas), optic pathway glioma, bony lesion (such as sphenoid wing dysplasia, or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudarthrosis), and/or NF1 diagnosed in a first-degree relative. Café au lait macules may be seen in the localized, segmental forms of NF1 in the setting of postsomatic mutations in the NF1 gene. In contrast to café au lait spots, ashleaf spots are hypopigmented and are seen in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC, discussed in questions 61 to 63). Shagreen patches are connective tissue hamartomas also seen in tuberous sclerosis. Plexiform neurofibromas are discussed in question 54. The other disorders listed are also neurocutaneous disorders, collectively known as the phakomatoses. Unlike NF1, neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is not diagnosed by the presence of specific cutaneous findings but rather by other criteria (see questions 85 and 86). Sturge–Weber syndrome is marked by the presence of hemangiomas (discussed in questions 80 and 81). Tuberous sclerosis complex (discussed in questions 61 to 63) has 1214 specific cutaneous findings that differ from NF1. Legius’s syndrome is an autosomal dominant cutaneous syndrome caused by mutation in the SPRED1 gene located at 15q14. It is characterized by café au lait macules and axillary and inguinal freckling just like NF1. Unlike NF1, Legius’s syndrome is NOT associated with optic gliomas, neurofibromas, Lisch’s nodules, nor risk of malignancy. There are mild dysmorphisms including hypertelorism and macrocephaly, and there may be associated learning or attention deficits. Given that the child in this case has neurofibromas, the diagnosis in this case is NF1 and not Legius’s syndrome. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "The cobblestone malformations are classified within the spectrum of lissencephalies and were formerly known as lissencephalies type 2. Cobblestone malformations are neuronal migration disorders (not malformations of cortical organization) in which the cortical gray matter has reduced number of gyri and sulci that appear like cobblestones. There is reduced and abnormal white matter, and the cerebellum and brainstem may be abnormal or hypoplastic. Microscopically, the cortex has no recognizable layers and is dysplastic and thick. Hydrocephalus frequently occurs. Congenital muscular dystrophy and eye abnormalities are seen in these patients. Cobblestone malformations are associated with a spectrum of autosomal recessive syndromes including Walker–Warburg syndrome, Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, and muscle–eye–brain disease. These three syndromes share similar clinical features, 1215 including microcephaly, global developmental delay, epilepsy, hypotonia, and evidence of muscular dystrophy. Walker–Warburg is the most severe form, with smooth cerebral cortex and malformations of brainstem and cerebellum. Muscle– eye–brain disease has intermediate severity in terms of the cobblestone appearance of the cortex, more severe in the frontal regions. Eye abnormalities in Walker–Warburg and muscle–eye– brain disease include retinal hypoplasia, optic nerve atrophy, glaucoma, and cataracts. Muscle–eye–brain disease is seen most commonly in Finland but also occurs in other European populations. Fukuyama muscular dystrophy, which results from a mutation in the gene FKTN encoding for fukutin, is most common in Japan and is rare in other populations. It has the least amount of cortical abnormalities, but the muscular dystrophy is severe with progressive weakness and joint contractures. An elevated level of serum creatine kinase may be seen. Cobblestone malformations associated with muscle involvement have reduced glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. The genes involved in these conditions normally regulate glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. Collectively they may be referred to as congenital muscular dystrophies, or alpha-dystroglycanopathies, and are caused by gene mutations (from most severe to least severe) in POMT1, POMT2, LARGE, FKTN, FKRP, and POMGNT1, though there is poor genotype/phenotype correlation. As many as 30% to 40% of patients with clinical features of cobblestone lissencephaly may not have a mutation in one of these genes. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Deficiency of this enzyme produces an elevation of blood and urine levels of homocystine, homocysteine, and methionine. There are two variants of this condition, one that is pyridoxine responsive and another that is not, suggesting some residual activity of the cystathionine-β-synthase in the former type. Patients with homocystinuria are normal at birth but will later have developmental delay and intellectual disability. Given the accumulation of homocysteine, collagen metabolism is affected, leading to involvement of other organs such as the eyes, bones, and the vascular system. Ectopia lentis is very common. These patients have a marfanoid habitus and are tall and thin, with pectus carinatum, pes planus, genu valgum, scoliosis, and osteoporosis. Vascular involvement is characterized by intimal thickening of the blood vessel walls and high incidence of thromboembolism, including strokes that may occur at early ages. There is elevation of plasma homocysteine and methionine levels and urine homocystine concentration. All patients suspected of homocystinuria should be treated with daily pyridoxine, maintained on a low-protein diet, specifically a diet low in methionine with cystine supplementation, and may be treated with betaine, a substance that lowers plasma homocysteine level by promoting its conversion to methionine. Folate and vitamin B 12 also promote the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and decrease the levels of homocysteine. 1217 Homocystinuria is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment. Other enzyme deficiencies can also cause elevation of homocysteine, including deficiency of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase and methionine synthase. Clinical manifestations are different, and these patients have elevated homocysteine, and homocystinuria with low methionine levels. Piña-Garza JE.

Lisch’s nodules do not have any clinical implications beyond their occurrence in NF1; they do not cause symptoms or progress to other ophthalmologic abnormalities. They most commonly appear after the age of 6 years and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis of NF1. Asymptomatic retinal hamartomas less commonly occur in NF1 as well. Congenital or childhood glaucoma ipsilateral to a plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid is another ophthalmologic manifestation of NF1. The diagnostic criteria for NF1 are discussed in questions 46 to 48. Kayser–Fleisher rings are seen in Wilson’s disease. Brushfield’s spots are white spots in the iris seen in Down’s syndrome. Iris colobomas (defects in the iris) are seen in a variety of disorders, including epidermal nevus syndrome and CHARGE syndrome (coloboma, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retardation of development, genitourinary abnormalities, ear abnormalities), but not in NF1. Iris mammillations are hyperpigmented iris lesions that can be confused with Lisch’s nodules. Heterochromia iridum refers to having two different colors of the iris. In complete heterochromia iridum, the two irises are entirely different colors, 1218 but in sectoral heterochromia, there may be one iris with more than one color. Sectoral heterochromia iridum may be seen in Sturge Weber syndrome ipsilateral to the port-wine stain. This patient with cutaneous lesions most likely consistent with café au lait macules, axillary freckles, and Lisch’s nodules meets criteria for NF1.

      "explicacao": "A heterotopia is a cluster of abnormally located neurons that are otherwise normal in morphology. Heterotopias result from abnormal neuronal migration. The most common form of heterotopia is periventricular nodular heterotopia (also known as subependymal nodular heterotopia) located, as the name implies, near the lateral ventricles. However, heterotopias can be found in various regions (such as subcortical nodular heterotopias, or transmantle heterotopias, which extend from the ventricles to the cortex). In periventricular nodular heterotopia, neurons are thought to have never begun migration but rather remained in the periventricular area (where postmitotic differentiating cortical neurons originate). This disorder is most often bilateral, but it can also be unilateral. In more than half of cases, this disorder results from mutations in the FLNA gene ( FILAMIN A ) on chromosome Xq28. The FLNA gene encodes a protein involved in cytoskeleton stabilization and focal adhesions, and abnormalities in this protein lead to disruption in cell migration by impeding attachment of neurons to the radial glia. Periventricular nodular heterotopias 1219 may be seen in isolation or as part of a syndrome associated with multiple other anomalies. Epilepsy is a common clinical manifestation, with partial seizures being most common. Intelligence may be entirely normal, or borderline, and patients may be at risk for cardiovascular manifestations. Periventricular nodular heterotopia is X-linked dominant, primarily affecting heterozygous females, with early lethality in hemizygous males; occasionally, males with FLNA mutations will survive but will be more severely affected with profound developmental delay.

      "explicacao": "Figure 14.9 depicts a plexiform neurofibroma. Neurofibromas, seen in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1, discussed in questions 46 to 48), occur in two types: cutaneous neurofibromas, as shown in Figure 14.6 , which originate in the dermis or adjacent layers, and plexiform neurofibromas, which originate in peripheral nerves. Plexiform neurofibromas consist predominantly of Schwann cells and fibroblasts but also contain mast cells, may occur anywhere, including the face, and can be disfiguring. Involvement of the overlying skin causes hypertrophy, hyperpigmentation, and thickening of the skin. Plexiform neurofibromas may involve deep internal structures and sometimes can be detected only by imaging. Neurofibromas that arise from dorsal root ganglia can grow in a dumbbell shape, invading the spinal canal and leading to nerve root and even spinal cord compression. Neurofibromas can arise also in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Plexiform neurofibromas can enlarge and become disfiguring when superficial and may impede function or be painful. Growth can be unpredictable, sometimes with periods of quiescence. These 1220 lesions should be monitored closely, since in a minority, they can undergo malignant transformation into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Surgical resection of plexiform neurofibromas may be required to help reduce disfigurement, pain, or dysfunction, though surgery may be complicated by bleeding, and multiple debulking surgeries may be required when residual neurofibroma continues to enlarge.

      "explicacao": "Urea cycle disorders are a group of conditions caused by deficiency of enzymes responsible for urea synthesis, and more importantly, ammonia and ammonia-containing compound removal. Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder and is X-linked recessive, caused by mutations in the OTC gene at Xp11.4. The other urea cycle disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and include (from most severe to least severe) carbamoylphosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPS1 deficiency, 2q34), citrullinemia type I (argininosuccinate synthetase-1, ASS1 deficiency, 9q34.11), argininosuccinic aciduria (argininosuccinic acid lyase, ASL deficiency, 7q11.21), and arginase deficiency (hyperargininemia, ARG deficiency, 6q23.2). These enzyme defects will lead to the triad of hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis, the common clinical manifestations suggestive of this group of disorders. Ammonia induces glutamine accumulation, which leads to astrocyte swelling and brain edema. These patients have very high-serum concentration of ammonia, no evidence of organic acidemia, normal anion gap, and normal serum glucose level. Amino acid analyses help distinguish specific urea cycle disorders, and enzyme activity can be evaluated in liver biopsy specimens. 1221 Clinical manifestations of OTC deficiency in males often begin in the newborn period with progressive lethargy, vomiting, hypotonia, and seizures. Higher levels of ammonia may be associated with coma and eventually death. Females with OTC deficiency, and some males with partial deficiencies, may have late-onset presentations and become symptomatic after large amounts of protein ingestion or intercurrent illnesses. Arginase deficiency does not cause symptoms in the newborn, whereas newborn presentation is common in the rest of urea cycle disorders. Treatment includes limitation of nitrogen intake in the diet and administration of essential amino acids. Calories can be supplied with carbohydrates and fat. During acute episodes, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetic acid are used, and sometimes dialysis may be required. Mannitol has been used for brain edema and increased intracranial pressure. Long-term treatment with low- protein diet and essential amino acids, as well as arginine supplementation (except in arginase deficiency), may stabilize the neurologic deterioration. Piña-Garza JE.

These may co-occur in the same patient. Polymicrogyria can be unilateral or bilateral, generalized, perisylvian, predominantly frontal, or in a variety of other patterns. The perisylvian form is the most common. Polymicrogyria often occurs as part of various syndromes, either sporadically or in familial forms. Several genetic mutations have 1222 been identified in association with polymicrogyria; however, nongenetic causes have also been reported, including hypoxia, hypoperfusion, and congenital infections (mainly cytomegalovirus). Polymicrogyria has also been associated with metabolic disorders such Zellweger’s syndrome (discussed in question 28). Clinical manifestations depend on the location and the extent of the abnormality; epilepsy and developmental delay are common. Schizencephaly, or cleft brain, most often occurs in the perisylvian region but can occur in other regions and can be unilateral or bilateral. In closed-lip schizencephaly, the cerebral cortical walls on either side of the cleft are in contact. In open-lip schizencephaly, the two walls are separated by CSF. Schizencephaly may be an isolated finding or associated with polymicrogyria and other abnormalities, with absent septum pellucidum being a frequent finding. Schizencephaly may be associated with septo-optic dysplasia (see question 30). The etiology of schizencephaly is not completely clear. Nongenetic causes include congenital infections and in utero hypoxic insult, whereas schizencephaly may be associated with mutations of the homeobox gene EMX2. Porencephaly is distinguished from schizencephaly in that the cleft of schizencephaly is lined uniformly with gray matter. Porencephalic cysts are not due to malformations of cortical development but are rather CSF-filled cysts that most often result from in utero infarction or other insult. Porencephalic cysts are lined by white matter or gliosis. Prayson RA. Neuropathology: A Volume in the Series: Foundations in Diagnostic Pathology. 2nd ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012.

Thickening of the left optic nerve as seen in Figure 14.10 likely represents an optic nerve glioma. Optic nerve gliomas are the most common tumor of the CNS seen in patients with NF1 and may be unilateral or bilateral. These are often low-grade lesions but may cause symptoms due to mass effect, including diplopia, pain, and proptosis. Optic pathway gliomas can occur anywhere along the optic pathways, from the optic nerve to the optic radiations. Optic chiasm gliomas may present with precocious puberty when they lead to pressure on diencephalic structures. Because these lesions are often benign, serial imaging over time is often used to monitor these tumors, with chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery instituted as necessary. On MRI, nonspecific subcortical T2 hyperintensities (in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and other regions) are common in patients with NF1 and are of unclear etiology and significance; these may be hamartomatous or dysmyelinating and are referred to commonly by their appearance as “unidentified bright objects” or UBOs. While potentially difficult to appreciate on a single image, Figure 14.10 also shows enlargement of the pons, which possibly represents a low-grade glioma. As mentioned, schwannomas and ependymomas can occur in NF1, but these are rare; they more commonly occur in NF2. Patients with NF1 are at an increased risk of cerebral, cerebellar, and brainstem astrocytomas. Since the NF1 gene functions as a tumor suppressor, patients with NF1 are also at an increased risk for leukemia and other malignancies. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "The patient’s history is consistent with autism spectrum disorder 1224 (ASD). Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by the presence of impaired social interaction and social communication skills and restricted and/or repetitive repertoire of activities, interests, and behavior patterns. The symptoms begin in early developmental stages and limit daily function, causing impairment of social, occupational, and/or other aspects of the child’s life. Impaired communication skills entail both verbal and nonverbal skills. Social skill abnormalities include lack of eye contact or atypical eye contact, failure to develop peer relationships, and lack of emotional reciprocity. Motor stereotypies, repetitive voluntary behaviors such as those described in the case, lack of flexibility, persistent preoccupation with specific objects or part of an object, and ritualistic patterns of behavior occur. When making a diagnosis of ASD, additional information should be specified, such as the presence of intellectual disability, accompanying language impairment, presence of catatonia, and if a medical, genetic, or environmental condition is associated (such as ASD associated with mitochondrial cytopathy). The severity of autism is graded as follows: level 1 (requires support), level 2 (requires substantial support), and level 3 (requires very substantial support). Asperger’s disorder and pervasive developmental disorder are no longer recognized as separate entities and now fall under the diagnosis called ASD. The ASD spectrum is broad, ranging from high-functioning individuals to nonverbal children with little interaction and no language skills. Cognitive delay is not a diagnostic criterion but may be an associated feature, although supranormal intelligence quotients (IQs) and savantism may (rarely) occur. Some improvements occur in adolescence, although seizures, mood disorders, or other comorbidities may also emerge. A genetic basis has been postulated given high concordance rates among monozygotic twins and increased incidence in families with more than one child with autism. Neuropathology seen in patients with autism includes underdevelopment of limbic structures and reduced cerebellar Purkinje cells. Several genetic and metabolic disorders have been associated with ASD, including neurofibromatosis 1, Down’s syndrome, fragile X mental retardation, fetal alcohol syndrome, and peroxisomal disorders, 1225 among others. A diagnostic workup for these disorders based on individual patient’s history and examination is indicated.

Developmental delay is defined by performance on standardized tests of function, that is, more than 2 standard deviations below the mean. Intellectual disability is a diagnosis made on the basis of testing IQ and is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the IQ, the degree of impairment, and the level of assistance in daily activities and other activities that are required. Mild intellectual disability is defined by an IQ of 55 to 70, whereas severe intellectual disability is defined by an IQ of 25 to 40. A myriad of causes for developmental delay exist, including but not limited to genetic disorders, toxin exposure, and metabolic disorders. Some causes of intellectual disability due to gross chromosomal abnormalities are discussed later. Some of the other genetic causes of intellectual disability are discussed in questions 64 and 65. Some of the acquired causes are discussed in question 68. Down’s syndrome, or trisomy 21, results from inheriting three copies (i.e., trisomy) of the 21st chromosome or, less commonly, 1226 chromosomal translocations resulting in three copies of a portion of chromosome 21. Diagnosis is made in the majority of cases through karyotyping. Increased maternal age is a risk factor. The frontal lobes are small and underdeveloped, and the superior temporal gyri are small and thin. Clinical features include presence of medial epicanthal folds, slanting palpebral fissures, micrognathia (small mouth) leading to an apparently large tongue, the so-called simian crease (in which there is a single palmar crease), Brushfield’s spots (white spots of depigmentation in the iris), clinodactyly (incurving of the fingers), short stature, and other features. In addition to varying degrees of intellectual disability, seizures (including infantile spasms), hematologic malignancies (such as leukemia), and congenital heart defects occur. Early dementia with Alzheimer-type pathology is seen, as the β-amyloid gene is on chromosome 21. These patients are at risk of cervical spinal cord compression due to atlantoaxial instability. Trisomy 13 or Patau’s syndrome is characterized by microcephaly, microphthalmia, iris coloboma, low-set ears, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly (excess number of fingers), prominence of the heels, and cardiac abnormalities. Life expectancy is typically not beyond early childhood. Trisomy 18 is characterized by microcephaly, ptosis, overlapping of the third finger over the second finger, rocker-bottom feet, umbilical hernia, congenital heart disease, and other findings. Life expectancy is typically not beyond early infancy. In Klinefelter’s syndrome, two X chromosomes are present in a male: XXY. Clinical features include intellectual disability, a wide arm span, high-pitched voice, gynecomastia (enlarged breasts), and small testes. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP.

Arrest of head growth with eventual (acquired) microcephaly, seizures, scoliosis, dysautonomia including respiratory dysfunction with apneas, and spasticity emerge as the disease progresses. Rett’s syndrome results from a mutation in the MECP2 gene located at Xq28 that encodes methyl CpG binding protein 2, which is involved in binding to methylated DNA, modulating gene expression. This X-linked disorder is most often seen in females, and it is thought to be most often fatal in boys, although cases of MECP2 mutations in male infants and children with intellectual disability and other features have been identified. A Rett-like syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability and early- onset seizures in females results from a mutation in the gene CDKL5 found at Xp22.5. Chahrour M, Zoghbi HY.

      "explicacao": "Given the combination of cutaneous findings shown, ashleaf spots in Figure 14.11 , and facial angiofibromas in Figure 14.12 , this patient’s diagnosis is tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder caused by mutations in either TSC1 ( HAMARTIN, 9q34.13) or TSC2 ( TUBERIN, 16p13.3) that affects multiple organ systems including the skin, brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys among others. 1228 The diagnosis of TSC can be made clinically on the basis of the following features: Major features: • Hypomelanotic macules (three or more of at least 5 mm in diameter) (including ashleaf spots, Fig. 14.11 ) • Angiofibromas (three or more) ( Fig. 14.12 ) or fibrous cephalic plaque ( Fig. 14.13 ) • Ungual fibromas (two or more) ( Fig. 14.14 ) • Shagreen patch • Multiple retinal hamartomas • Cortical dysplasias (including tubers and cerebral white matter radial migration lines) • Subependymal nodules (see Fig. 14.17 ) • Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (see Fig. 14.15 ) • Cardiac rhabdomyoma • Lymphangioleiomyomatosis • Angiomyolipomas (two or more) Minor features: • “Confetti” skin lesions (hypopigmented, stippled lesions on the extremities) • Dental enamel pits (more than three) • Intraoral fibromas (two or more) • Retinal achromic patch • Multiple renal cysts • Nonrenal hamartomas (Criteria from Northrup H, Krueger DA, on behalf of the International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group. Tuberous sclerosis complex diagnostic criteria update: recommendations of the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference. Pediatr Neurol. 2013; 49:243–254.) Note that a definite diagnosis can be made with two major features or one major and two minor features. A possible diagnosis can be made with either one major feature or two or more minor features. The combination of lymphangioleiomyomatosis and angiomyolipomas without other features does not meet criteria for 1229 a definite diagnosis. A genetic diagnosis of TSC can be made by identifying TSC1 or TSC2 pathogenic mutation in DNA from normal tissue, in which the mutation clearly inactivates the function of either of these proteins. A normal result on genetic testing does not exclude TSC, since approximately 10% to 25% of patients with TSC have no mutation found on conventional genetic testing. Figure 14.11 shows three hypopigmented (hypomelanotic) patches known as ashleaf spots. These are not specific for TSC but occur in the majority of patients with TSC and are often present at birth but become more obvious with age; in newborns, examination under ultraviolet light (i.e., Wood’s lamp) makes them more apparent. Tinea corporis, a fungal infection, also leads to circular lesions on the trunk, but tinea has a different appearance. Figure 14.12 shows facial angiofibromas, also known as adenoma sebaceum, which are hamartomatous lesions consisting of vascular and connective tissue. They often become apparent in early childhood as papules in the malar region and become more apparent and numerous with time: they characteristically progress to involve the nasolabial folds and sometimes the chin. Facial angiofibromas may resemble acne if not examined closely and if other historical and clinical features are not taken into consideration. Shagreen patches are cutaneous hamartomas that have irregular borders and are raised. Shagreen patches most often occur on the trunk (back or flank). These lesions may not be present in childhood but may appear later in life. Hamartomas can occur in a variety of body parts in TSC including the retina and the gastrointestinal tract. The other disorders listed in the choices are also neurocutaneous disorders but with distinct cutaneous and other clinical features and with specific diagnostic criteria. Cutaneous neurofibromas are shown in Figure 14.6 and café au lait macules in Figure 14.5 ; these occur in neurofibromatosis (discussed in questions 46 to 48). Hypomelanosis of Ito is associated with hypopigmented lesions that may be patchy but more often follow skin lines in streaks (discussed in question 43). Sturge–Weber syndrome is discussed in questions 80 and 81 and epidermal nevus syndrome in question 93.

      "resposta_correta": "e",
      "explicacao": "There are a variety of causes of intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability. It results from expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in the Familial Mental Retardation 1 ( FMR1 ) gene on chromosome Xq27.3. (A mnemonic for remembering the CGG trinucleotide repeat is, C hild with G iant G onads). The FMR1 protein appears to be an important RNA-binding protein that binds to mRNAs from many genes associated with autism spectrum disorders, though its exact cellular function is yet to be fully elucidated. Because this gene is on the X chromosome, and because random X inactivation (lyonization) occurs in females, they are less often and less severely affected. Clinical manifestations in males include an elongated face, with a high forehead and elongated jaw, protuberant ears, and enlarged testes (in postpubertal patients). The degree of intellectual disability ranges from mild and subtle to severe. A family history of intellectual disability in males may be present.

Prader–Willi 1231 syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by profound infantile hypotonia often requiring a gastric feeding tube in the neonatal period, short stature, dysmorphic facies including a wide mouth, small feet, developmental delay, hypogonadism (with cryptorchidism in males), hyperphagia, and obesity. Infants feed poorly but then become hyperphagic when older. Another disorder associated with developmental delay and obesity is Laurence–Moon syndrome. Angelman’s syndrome is a genetically related disorder characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, intractable epilepsy, ataxia, inappropriate laughter with a wide-based stance and flailing of the arms at the sides during ambulation (hence the name “happy puppet syndrome”), prominent jaw with thin upper lip, and impaired speech development. Another genetic disorder associated with developmental delay and a happy affect is Williams syndrome, which is associated with congenital heart disease, increased verbal abilities, and “elfin” facies, and is caused by deletions of approximately 26 genes on chromosome 7q. Prader–Willi and Angelman’s syndrome both result from a microdeletion on chromosome 15q11-q13. The same mutation leads to Prader–Willi syndrome when it is paternally inherited and to Angelman’s syndrome when it is maternally inherited, so-called imprinting. Cri-du-chat syndrome is characterized by an abnormal, cat-like cry, intellectual disability, presence of epicanthal folds, hypertelorism (in which the eyes are farther apart than normal), micrognathia, and other features. It is caused by a deletion on chromosome 5p. Fragile X is discussed in question 64. Rett’s syndrome is discussed in question 60. Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP.

      },
      "resposta_correta": "b",
      "explicacao": "Methylmalonic acidemia is an autosomal recessive condition most commonly caused by the deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ( MUT, 6p12.3). This enzyme normally catalyzes the isomerization of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which then enters the 1232 Krebs cycle. A required cofactor is 5′-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin. A defect in this metabolic pathway leads to accumulation of propionyl-CoA, propionic acid, and methylmalonic acid, causing metabolic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, and hyperammonemia. Affected children appear normal at birth, becoming symptomatic within the first week of life, manifesting with lethargy, failure to thrive, vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia, and respiratory distress. Hematologic abnormalities, including bleeding disorders leading to intracranial hemorrhage, may also occur. Patients who survive are left with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and recurrent acidosis. The diagnosis should be suspected in newborn patients with metabolic acidosis, ketosis, hyperglycinemia, and hyperammonemia. Methylmalonic acid is elevated in plasma and urine, and the enzyme activity can be analyzed in fibroblasts. B12- responsive forms of methylmalonic acidemia are associated with mutations in genes that affect the transport or synthesis of 5′- Deoxyadenosylcobalamin (cblA, cblB, or cblD variant 2 type), or deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase. Patients with these forms may present later than patients with MUT mutations and may improve with specific forms of vitamin B12 supplementation. Patients with methylmalonic acidemia should be treated with protein restriction, and supplementation with intramuscular hydroxycobalamin and enteral carnitine. Antibiotics are also helpful to reduce the production of propionic acid by gut flora. In the acute setting, these patients need hydration and glucose administration with discontinuation of protein intake. This condition is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment in patients with the classic or severe form of the disease, though patients may become symptomatic before the newborn screening results return.

Congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus and rubella lead to intellectual disability with a variety of other features such as congenital blindness, sensorineural hearing loss, and periventricular calcifications. Environmental exposures including exposure to ionizing radiation during the first trimester of pregnancy have also been associated with intellectual disability. The embryo is susceptible to radiation especially during organogenesis and the early fetal period, resulting in mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic changes, which could be related to the level of exposure. Intellectual disability and growth restriction can be seen after radiation exposure in these early periods. Exposure to ionizing radiation in utero is also associated with the risk of childhood malignancy, especially leukemia. Malnutrition during the first few months of life can lead to reversible cognitive delay. Maternal intake of alcohol, antiepileptics (including valproate and phenytoin), vitamin A, and thalidomide are also linked to various nervous system and systemic malformations as well as intellectual disability, as are several other 1234 agents. Maternal alcohol intake is a common cause of acquired (nongenetic) intellectual disability. Other features of fetal alcohol syndrome include behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, microcephaly, short palpebral fissure (a short distance between the inner and outer canthi of the eyes), presence of epicanthal folds, hypoplasia of the maxilla, micrognathia, and thin upper lip with flattened philtrum.

      "explicacao": "Biotin is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin that is necessary in multiple metabolic reactions including gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, catabolism of amino acids, and gene expression. Its deficiency can be caused by biotinidase deficiency. This enzyme normally cleaves biocytin (an amide formed from biotin and L- lysine), an intermediate in biotin metabolism, thereby recycling biotin; biotinidase also participates in processing of dietary protein- bound biotin, making it available to the free biotin pool. Biotinidase deficiency has previously been known as late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion due to mutations in the biotinidase gene ( BTD, 3p25.1). Children with this enzymatic defect manifest with seizures, hypotonia, ataxia, developmental delay, hearing and vision loss, spastic paraparesis, and cutaneous abnormalities including alopecia. Laboratory studies demonstrate ketoacidosis, hyperammonemia, and organic aciduria. Biotinidase enzyme activity can be analyzed in serum, with profound biotinidase deficiency characterized as <10% of normal activity, and partial biotinidase deficiency characterized as between 10% and 30% of normal activity. Treatment is oral free biotin supplementation, which if begun early enough prevents intellectual disability and reverses most of the symptoms. However, once vision, hearing, and developmental/intellectual impairments occur, they are not reversible. This condition is screened for by extended newborn screening, thus allowing for presymptomatic treatment in most patients with the classic or severe form of the disease.

Neural tube defects, including encephalocele, and anomalies in other organ systems, including the heart, may occur. Another association is with facial hemangiomas.

      "explicacao": "Betz cells are the upper motor neurons of the nervous system; these are large cells found in the primary motor cortex. The majority of the cerebral cortex (>90%) consists of neocortex (also known as isocortex), a six-layered cortex (as opposed to more primitive cortex with less numbers of layers, as occurs in the paleocortex [found in olfactory and limbic cortices] and archicortex, seen in the hippocampus). The six layers of the neocortex are molecular layer (layer I, most superficial, covered by the pia), external granular cell layer (layer II), external pyramidal cell layer (layer III), internal granular cell layer (layer IV), internal pyramidal cell layer (layer V), and multiform layer (layer VI, deepest layer, overlying the subcortical white matter). Corticocortical efferents (projections from one area of cortex to another) arise mainly in layer III and project predominantly to layers II and III. Layers I, IV, and VI receive the majority of thalamic efferents. Layer V gives rise to corticostriate projections (from cortex to striatum), and layer VI gives rise to corticothalamic projections (from cortex to thalamus). Pyramidal cells are excitatory (i.e., glutamatergic) projection neurons that constitute the largest number (∼80%) of cortical neurons and are found in highest numbers in cortical areas that 1238 give rise to efferents; granular (or stellate) neurons are smaller cells (≤15 micrometers) that function predominantly as cortical interneurons and predominate in regions involved in sensory function or integration (secondary association cortices, etc.). Betz cells are the upper motor neurons of the nervous system; these are large cells found in layer V of the primary motor cortex. Formation of gyri and sulci normally occurs between weeks 20 and 36 of gestation. Abnormalities in this process can lead to a variety of malformations of cortical development. Prayson RA.

It is caused by mutations in the gene GBA on chromosome 1q21 and is more common in Ashkenazi Jews. There are three phenotypes: • Type 1 is the most common and does not involve the CNS early on. It is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with anemia and thrombocytopenia, skeletal involvement, and pulmonary infiltrates. While, as mentioned, early CNS involvement does not occur, adults with Gaucher’s type 1 (as well as individuals with heterozygote mutations in the GBA gene) are at a markedly increased risk of Parkinson’s disease compared to the general population. • Type 2 has its onset before the age of 2 years, with psychomotor involvement, spasticity, choreoathetosis, oculomotor abnormalities, and progresses to death by 2 to 4 years of age. These patients may also have hepatosplenomegaly, hydrops fetalis, and cutaneous changes. • Type 3 begins after the age of 2 years and progresses slowly, with hepatosplenomegaly, psychomotor deterioration, spasticity, ataxia, and oculomotor involvement. 1239 The diagnosis can be made with an analysis of the enzyme β- glucosylceramidase or glucocerebrosidase in leukocytes. This enzyme can also be tested for in amniocytes and through chorionic villous sampling, allowing for prenatal diagnosis. Gaucher’s cells are caused by the lysosomal storage of glucocerebroside in macrophages. These cells are found in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and have large cytoplasm with striated appearance, what has been likened to “wrinkled tissue paper.” In the CNS, the brainstem and deep nuclei are most severely affected, and neuronal degeneration is seen, likely from neurotoxic action of glucosylsphingosine. For patients with Gaucher’s type 1, enzyme replacement with one of the three commercially available intravenous enzymes, imiglucerase, taliglucerase alfa, and velaglucerase alfa, can be effective for liver and spleen involvement and for the hematologic abnormalities. For those patients who cannot tolerate enzyme replacement, the oral substrate inhibitors eliglustat and miglustat are available and may be effective.

Cortical tubers contain large bizarre neurons, abnormal glia, predominantly astrocytes, and hypomyelinated axons. These lesions are not premalignant. Cortical tubers do not grow; however, their appearance on MRI change over time as the child ages, likely secondary to the myelination process. Central nervous system manifestations of TSC include cognitive 1240 abnormalities from learning disabilities to intellectual disability, although up to half of the patients with TSC have normal intelligence. Seizures occur in the majority of patients with TSC. A variety of seizure types may occur in patients with TSC; TSC is the most common cause of infantile spasms and, in such cases, treatment with vigabatrin is often of benefit. Early treatment of epilepsy in infants with TSC has been shown to preserve intellectual function. Other common neuropsychiatric manifestations of TSC include autism spectrum disorder and behavioral problems including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities.

The patient in question 77 has another GM2 gangliosidosis, more specifically Sandhoff’s disease caused by deficiency of hexosaminidase A and B. β-Galactosidase deficiency causes GM1 but not GM2 gangliosidosis. Sphingomyelinase deficiency causes Niemann–Pick types A and B. GM2 gangliosidosis is caused by deficiency of hexosaminidase A in Tay–Sachs disease or hexosaminidase A and B in Sandhoff’s disease. These isoenzymes are made of subunits, with hexosaminidase A containing alpha–beta, and hexosaminidase B containing beta–beta. Mutations in the HEXA gene disrupt alpha subunits only, giving rise to Tay–Sachs disease, whereas HEXB mutations disrupt the beta subunit, resulting in deficiency of both 1241 hexosaminidases A and B. Both are rare autosomal recessive diseases, occurring in approximately 1:320,000 newborns in the United States’ general population. Tay–Sachs disease or infantile GM2 gangliosidosis is more common in Ashkenazi Jews, with heterogeneous carrier rates as high as 1:25 to 30 people, though carrier screening has reduced the incidence of Tay–Sachs disease in Ashkenazi populations by 90%. Other populations with higher incidence of Tay–Sachs disease include some French–Canadian families in Quebec, some Amish populations, and Cajun populations in Louisiana, though the disease may also occur in other populations with less frequency. In Tay–Sachs disease, the CNS is the only affected system, differentiating it from Sandhoff’s disease which affects both the CNS and the viscera, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly. Onset is between 3 and 6 months of age, with increased startle response and subsequent motor regression, spasticity, blindness with optic atrophy, and seizures. There is a delay in reaching developmental milestones, with subsequent developmental regression. A cherry- red spot in the macula is commonly seen, and these patients have macrocephaly. Progression to severe intellectual disability occurs, and most children die by the age of 5 years. The diagnosis is suspected in patients with psychomotor retardation and a cherry- red spot and is confirmed with the detection of hexosaminidase A deficiency with normal activity of hexosaminidase B. Targeted mutation analysis or gene sequencing of the HEXA gene to detect specific mutations may be helpful to identify asymptomatic carriers in the family and to differentiate between disease-causing mutations and so-called pseudodeficiency alleles that result in decreased hexosaminidase A activity in the laboratory but do not cause disease. Treatment of Tay–Sachs disease is supportive. Sandhoff’s disease occurs from combined deficiency of hexosaminidase A and B. The clinical features are similar to those seen in Tay–Sachs disease; however, as mentioned, in Tay–Sachs disease, the CNS is the only system involved, whereas in Sandhoff’s disease, the GM2 gangliosides accumulate in the brain and the viscera, causing hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis is based on these clinical features and confirmed with analysis of the enzymatic 1242 activity of the enzymes involved. Sandhoff’s disease rarely occurs in Ashkenazi Jewish populations.

      "explicacao": "Figure 14.17 shows multiple periventricular hyperdense lesions. These are known as subependymal nodules, and their presence is one of the major diagnostic criteria of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (see question 61 to 63). Subependymal nodules, as their name suggests, most commonly occur beneath the ependyma of the lateral ventricles, along the caudate nucleus. They are thought to arise from remnants of the germinal matrix. They typically remain stable but do have the potential to grow over time, usually until adolescence, and later become calcified. They are asymptomatic unless they grow. There is controversy regarding the relationship between subependymal nodules and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) (see question 72), with some authors suggesting that subependymal nodules give rise to SEGAs. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas typically arise at the caudothalamic groove but can be found anywhere within the ventricles and rarely are found extraventricularly. They are larger than subependymal nodules and more likely to grow and cause obstructive hydrocephalus. Histopathologically, subependymal nodules and SEGAs are similar but radiographically, subependymal nodules are calcified and nonenhancing whereas SEGAs will actively enhance. Unlike cortical tubers (discussed in question 75), the presence and number of subependymal nodules are not thought to correlate with cognitive function or seizures. Benign hereditary calcification of the basal ganglia (Fahr’s disease, see Chapter 6 ) is on the differential diagnosis of subcortical calcifications, but the distribution of these calcifications is typically within the striatum or thalamus and they are not as nodular as these subependymal nodules are.

SWS is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by the presence of cutaneous angioma of the face, also known as the port-wine nevus, which often occurs in a trigeminal distribution, as seen in Figure 14.18A but may involve any part of the body. Associated features in some cases include angiomatosis of the ipsilateral and less commonly bilateral leptomeninges and the cortex, as seen in Figure 14.18B , most frequently affecting the parietal and occipital lobes. Some patients have only cutaneous findings without CNS involvement; this is most often the case if cutaneous angiomas are present only in the limbs (without facial involvement). Neurologic manifestations are variable; some patients may have no neurologic signs or symptoms, whereas others may have seizures, contralateral hemiparesis, and/or developmental delay. Central nervous system involvement is most common in those with cutaneous angiomas involving the face, particularly the V1 trigeminal distribution with inclusion of the inner canthus of the eye. Cobb’s syndrome, or cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis, is a variant of SWS in which cutaneous angiomas occur in a dermatome corresponding to a spinal dural angioma. Glaucoma and buphthalmos (enlargement of the eye) may be a complication of SWS but presenile cataracts are not. The pathophysiology of SWS is thought to relate to persistence of embryonal blood vessels that normally regress during gestation; inheritance appears to be sporadic, but somatic mosaic mutations in GNAQ gene on chromosome 9q21 have been identified and are thought to be causal. Early somatic mutation of GNAQ results in a greater number of abnormal cell types, resulting in SWS, whereas later 1245 mutation may result in nonsyndromic cutaneous port-wine stains. The classic radiographic finding is one of gyral calcifications giving a tram-track appearance that may be initially best seen on a computed tomographic scan. Cerebral hemiatrophy, rather than hemimegalencephaly, is also seen, as shown in Figure 14.18B . MRA is useful in assessing the extent of intracranial involvement. Cerebral venous stasis, increased venous pressure due to AVMs and venous thrombosis, and leptomeningeal capillary–venous malformations may all contribute to progression of neurologic disability. Acute venous thrombosis may occur uncommonly. The other options listed are also neurocutaneous syndromes but each with distinct cutaneous and other neurologic findings. Neurocutaneous melanosis and incontinentia pigmenti are discussed in question 37, Hypomelanosis of Ito in question 43, and epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) in question 93.

A diagnosis of glycine encephalopathy (formerly called nonketotic hyperglycinemia) can be made on the basis of this MRI finding, along with the clinical picture and the high CSF glycine levels. Available treatment options for this condition are limited and not effective in preventing permanent neurologic injury. Glycine encephalopathy is an autosomal recessive disease. The onset is in newborns, who, within a few hours to days after birth become irritable with poor feeding and hiccups. Subsequently, they develop a progressive encephalopathy with hypotonia, myoclonic seizures, and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Patients who survive the acute phase will have profound intellectual disability, spasticity, and intractable epilepsy. Brain MRI may reveal a hypoplastic or absent corpus callosum, gyral malformations, and cerebellar hypoplasia. In the acute phase, the EEG shows burst suppression and hypsarrhythmia. Delta brushes are features of premature infant EEG appearing between 29 and 38 weeks of gestational age and result from superimposed delta and beta frequencies; they are not found in glycine encephalopathy. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia or glycine encephalopathy is caused by a defect in one of three proteins that together make up the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system, resulting in complete absence of function and the accumulation of glycine in all body tissues. The most common mutation (70% to 75%) occurs in the P- protein (glycine decarboxylase gene, GLDC, 9p24.1), while 20% are due to mutations in the T-protein (aminomethyltransferase, AMT gene, 3p21.31), and <1% have mutations in the H-protein gene ( GCSH, 16q23.2). Approximately 5% of cases have no identifiable mutation and are considered variant forms of glycine encephalopathy. 1247 Serum and CSF glycine levels are elevated, and the ratio of CSF to plasma glycine concentration is >0.6, whereas normally, it is <0.4. No effective treatments are available; sodium benzoate decreases plasma glycine concentrations, but the CSF level does not normalize with this therapy, and neurologic dysfunction is not reversible.

      "explicacao": "This patient has Krabbe’s disease on the basis of the history and histopathologic findings. Krabbe’s disease or globoid cell leukodystrophy is a disorder with autosomal recessive inheritance, caused by mutations in the galactocerebrosidase gene ( GALC, 14q31.3), leading to loss of enzymatic activity. (Galactocerebrosidase is also known as galactocerebroside β-galactosidase, and galactosylceramidase). This disorder is characterized by the accumulation of galactocerebrosides in macrophages of the white matter in the CNS, leading to the formation of globoid cells (see later) and to progressive demyelination, but with sparing of the U fibers. It can involve the peripheral nervous system, leading to a demyelinating neuropathy, but affects predominantly the CNS. There are three forms: • Infantile form: The most common variant and presents between 4 and 6 months of age with irritability, hypersensitivity to stimuli, increasing hypertonicity with eventual opisthotonos, unexplained low-grade fevers, optic atrophy with blindness, psychomotor developmental arrest, and subsequent regression 1248 with loss of previously achieved milestones. These children also have a demyelinating polyneuropathy with areflexia. They usually die by the age of 1 to 2 years. • Juvenile form: The onset is between 3 and 10 years of age, with vision loss, spasticity, ataxia, gait disturbance, and cognitive impairment. • Adult form: Usually starts between the third and the fifth decade of life, with spastic paraparesis, weakness, vision loss, and evidence of neuropathy, but intellectual function tends to be normal. Pathologically, there is symmetric demyelination of the cerebral white matter, with relative sparing of the subcortical arcuate or U fibers. The pathologic specimen shown in Figure 14.20 is typical of Krabbe’s disease, demonstrating clusters of globoid cells, which are PAS+ multinucleated macrophages with cytoplasmic accumulation of galactocerebroside. Radiologically, there is symmetric periventricular white matter signal abnormality and cerebral atrophy. NCS demonstrate slow conduction velocities and prolonged distal latencies.

      "explicacao": "The patient in question 85 meets diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF2 is less common than NF1 and has distinct diagnostic criteria, clinical manifestations, and pathophysiology. Diagnostic criteria for NF2 include one of the following: • Bilateral schwannomas of cranial nerve (CN) VIII. • Unilateral vestibular schwannoma and a family history of a 1249 first-degree relative with NF2. • A family history of a first-degree relative with NF2 combined with any two of the following lesions: neurofibroma, schwannoma, meningioma, glioma, posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities. • Unilateral vestibular schwannoma and two of the following: meningioma, glioma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, and posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities. • Multiple meningiomas and unilateral vestibular schwannoma or two of the following: glioma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, cataract. (From Evans DG. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2): a clinical and molecular review [published online ahead of print June 19, 2009]. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2009;4:16. In contrast to NF1 (discussed in questions 46 to 48), cutaneous lesions such as café au lait spots and neurofibromas (see Figs. 14.5 and 14.6 ) are uncommon in NF2, but they may occur. On the contrary, various CNS tumors occur more commonly in NF2, often in the same patient, including schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas of the brain and spine. Lisch’s nodules are uncommon in NF2, but epiretinal membranes are common and subcapsular cataracts do occur. NF2 is one of the neurocutaneous syndromes that are often not diagnosed until adulthood. NF2 is autosomal dominant, with variable expression and complete penetrance. It results from a mutation in the MERLIN (also known as SCHWANNOMIN ) gene on chromosome 22. MERLIN is a tumor suppressor gene, and mutations in this gene account for the various neoplasms seen in NF2. A variety of mutations in the NF2 gene have been identified, and the type of mutation correlates with clinical severity, with missense mutations leading to some functional protein production and milder clinical phenotype, and mutations with protein truncation leading to more severe disease. Gorlin’s syndrome and Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome are rare syndromes associated with multiple neoplasms, but this patient’s history of bilateral schwannomas combined with the family history is diagnostic of NF2. Tuberous sclerosis complex has distinct 1250 cutaneous and CNS findings as discussed in questions 61 to 63. Schwannomatosis is a distinct disorder characterized by the occurrence of multiple schwannomas affecting various CNs but not CN VIII. It may be segmental, and a pure spinal form also exists. It may be familial and has in some cases been associated with a mutation on chromosome 22 in a gene near but different from the gene mutated in NF2; a small percentage of cases of schwannomatosis are hereditary, with the majority being sporadic.

GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs secondary to a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme β-galactosidase, ( GLB1 gene, 3p22.3). Patients present between 6 and 18 months of age with incoordination, weakness, spasticity, seizures, psychomotor developmental arrest with subsequent regression, and a cherry-red spot in the macula. Dysmorphic, coarse facial features and hepatosplenomegaly are also present. These patients may be confused with Hurler’s syndrome, except that in GM1 gangliosidosis, patients have a cherry-red spot in the macula and do not have mucopolysacchariduria. Diagnosis is based on the detection of β-galactosidase deficiency 1251 in leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts. This enzymatic deficiency is responsible for the accumulation of GM1 gangliosides, keratan sulfate, and glycoproteins. Macroscopically, the brain may be large initially, but as neuronal loss occurs, brain atrophy ensues. Pathologically, initially there is lipid storage in the neurons and proximal axons leading to neuronal ballooning. Subsequently, there is neuronal loss and gliosis. Treatment is supportive. GLB1 mutations can also result in the phenotypically distinct mucopolysaccharisosis (MPS) IVB (Morquio’s syndrome, IVB). These patients typically present between 1 to 3 years of age but may not present until later childhood or adolescence. Patients with MPS IVB will have short stature, skeletal dysplasia, respiratory compromise, cardiac valvular abnormalities, and corneal clouding, and can suffer spinal cord compression; their intellectual function is typically normal. MPS IVB is associated with high levels of urine glycosaminoglycan (keratan sulfate). This patient does not have the GM2 gangliosidoses Tay–Sachs or Sandhoff’s disease.

Patients with the infantile form have megalencephaly, developmental delay, seizures, psychomotor developmental delay, spasticity, and quadriparesis. The juvenile form has onset in childhood, and these patients have more significant bulbar symptoms. The adult form manifests with bulbar signs, hyperreflexia, dysautonomia, ataxia, and sleep apnea. 1252 Brain MRI demonstrates diffuse white matter T2 hyperintensity, predominantly in the frontal lobes and anterior cerebral regions, with involvement of the U fibers. In the adult-onset form, the “tadpole sign” on sagittal MRI results from dramatic thinning of the upper cervical spinal cord.

TSC is caused either by a mutation in the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 that encodes for the protein hamartin or by a mutation in the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16 that encodes for the protein tuberin. Tuberin and hamartin interact with each other and other proteins to form the TSC, which normally functions to inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Abnormalities in these proteins lead to unregulated cell growth and proliferation, and mTOR inhibitors, such as the drug rapamycin and its 1253 analogues, can be used to treat patients with TSC. Although there are some genotype–phenotype correlations, the clinical manifestations of each mutation overlap significantly. TSC is also discussed in questions 61 to 63.

Mutations in this same gene also account for one form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. The onset of clinical manifestations is in the first few months of life, with intermittent nodding movements of the head, pendular nystagmus, and other abnormal eye movements. Ataxia, chorea, athetosis, dystonia, spasticity, and laryngeal stridor also occur, and psychomotor development arrests with subsequent regression. Late manifestations include seizures and optic atrophy. Patients with later onset may have slower progression, and some patients survive into adulthood. The MRI demonstrates diffuse hypomyelination characterized by T2 hyperintensity and loss of white matter with relative thinning of the corpus callosum.

In mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III or Sanfilippo’s syndrome, there is accumulation of heparan sulfate but not dermatan sulfate. Mucopolysaccharidoses are caused by impaired lysosomal degradation of glucosaminoglycans (not n-acetylaspartic acid, which accumulates in Canavan’s disease, see question 79), which are long unbranched molecules of repeating disaccharides. Various enzymatic defects lead to the accumulation of glucosaminoglycans in lysosomes and the extracellular matrix. The MPS are all autosomal recessive except for Hunter’s disease, which is X-linked. In general, MPS are a group of progressive multisystemic disorders that affect the cornea, cartilage, bone, connective tissue, reticuloendothelial system, and nervous system. Hurler’s syndrome is MPS type I and is caused by α-L- iduronidase deficiency. The gene is localized to chromosome 4, and there is accumulation of both dermatan and heparan sulfate. These patients are normal at birth, but within the first 2 years of life, they will develop coarsening of facial features, with progressive skeletal dysplasia with dysostosis multiplex and growth impairment (dwarfism). These patients have restricted range of motion of the joints, hearing loss, corneal clouding, macroglossia, hernias, visceromegaly, valvular heart disease, and prominent intellectual disability. Mild MPS type I is also known as Scheie’s syndrome, and the intermediate form is known as Hurler–Scheie syndrome. Most recently, MPS type I has been classified as severe 1255 MPS type I and attenuated MPS type I. The diagnosis of MPS type I is based on elevated urinary excretion of dermatan and heparan sulfate and confirmed with enzyme analysis in leukocytes and fibroblasts. Pathologically, there are cells with vacuolated appearance, expansion of perivascular spaces in the CNS, and neuronal lipidosis. Electron microscopy (not light microscopy) demonstrates reticulogranular material in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, and lamellar material in neurons, some of which adopt a layered appearance and are called zebra bodies. Enzyme replacement therapy can be used to treat non-CNS manifestations of the disease. Stem cell transplantation can be potentially helpful. Hunter’s syndrome or MPS type II is caused by a defect in iduronate sulfatase, with accumulation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. These patients have the Hurler phenotype but lack the corneal clouding and have characteristic nodular ivory-colored lesions on the back, shoulders, and upper arms. These children have short stature, macrocephaly, macroglossia, hoarse voice, hearing loss, visceromegaly, dysostosis multiplex, joint contractures, entrapment neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and intellectual disability. The diagnosis is based on mucopolysacchariduria and confirmed with analysis of the enzyme activity. Treatment is symptomatic. Other MPS include types III, IV, VI, VII, and IX as follows: • MPS type III or Sanfilippo’s syndrome has several subtypes (A, B, C, and D) and is associated with accumulation of heparan sulfate only. The main manifestation is intellectual disability. • MPS type IV or Morquio’s syndrome has two subtypes (A and B, see question 87), and they manifest with corneal clouding, dysostosis multiplex, and heart disease, with normal intelligence. • MPS type VI is also known as Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome and manifests with normal intelligence, dysostosis multiplex, corneal clouding, heart disease, and other features similar to Hurler’s syndrome. • MPS type VII is also known as Sly’s syndrome, and these patients have hydrops fetalis, intellectual disability, dysostosis 1256 multiplex, corneal clouding, and other features of Hurler’s syndrome. • MPS type IX is also known as Natowicz’s syndrome and is caused by deficiency of hyaluronidase with accumulation of hyaluronan.

These disorders include Proteus syndrome (characterized by asymmetric and often marked hypertrophy of soft tissues and bones and epidermal nevi), Becker nevus syndrome (hairy hyperpigmented plaque, smooth muscle hyperplasia, breast hypoplasia, and rib defects), Sebaceous nevus syndrome, Phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica, Nevus comedonicus syndrome, and CHILD (Congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects) syndrome. Epidermal nevi are slightly raised patches of hyperpigmentation that are present at birth or appear in childhood. They may enlarge over time. Not all patients have neurologic manifestations; occurrence of nevi over the face and scalp predict neurologic involvement. Neurologic manifestations may include intellectual disability, seizures, and cranial neuropathies. In patients with hemimegalencephaly (which often occurs ipsilateral to a facial nevus), contralateral hemiparesis may be seen. Other brain malformations seen in patients with ENS include focal pachygyria, lissencephaly, heterotopic gray matter, and other abnormalities of cortical development. Cerebral vascular abnormalities may also occur. Patients with ENS are at increased risk of malignancy; the nevus itself may undergo malignant transformation into basal cell carcinoma or other skin malignancies, and there is an increased risk of astrocytoma and other systemic malignancies. Various 1257 skeletal abnormalities may occur in ENS, including kyphoscoliosis and limb anomalies. Ocular abnormalities include iris colobomas (most common), retinal lesions, and strabismus.

The enzyme involved in AIP is porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase. Porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders caused by deficiency of a specific enzyme involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Most of the porphyrias are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, except 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase– deficient porphyria, which is autosomal recessive. AIP has primarily neurologic manifestations, HCP and VP have a combination of neurologic and cutaneous manifestations with photosensitivity, and porphyria cutanea tarda has cutaneous involvement with no neurologic manifestations. The acute porphyrias manifest with attacks of neurovisceral symptoms, with markedly elevated levels of plasma and urinary concentrations of the porphyrin precursors aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Levels are usually elevated during attacks and may be normal in between. The attacks may be triggered by drugs such as antiepileptics (especially barbiturates), sulfonamides, and hormones among other medications. Attacks may also be triggered by a low-carbohydrate diet, infections, or 1258 other intercurrent illnesses. AIP is the most common of the acute porphyrias with neurovisceral symptoms and is caused by deficiency of PBG deaminase ( PBGD gene, 11q23). Onset occurs after puberty, with acute attacks of abdominal pain, sometimes associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Commonly, these patients experience limb pain and muscle weakness resulting from a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly motor and axonal, affecting more proximal than distal segments and more the upper than the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are depressed. The radial nerve has been described as being classically involved, and in severe cases, there may be bulbar and respiratory involvement. Seizures can occur from neurologic involvement or may result from the hyponatremia that is seen in these patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, depression, disorientation, hallucinations, and paranoia may occur. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and elevated urinary excretion of ALA and PBG during the attacks. Genetic testing and enzyme analysis are also helpful. Management is focused on preventing attacks by avoiding precipitating factors. During attacks, these patients may need hospitalization for hydration and pain control. Carbohydrates decrease the synthesis of porphyrins and an infusion may be required. Hematin infusions may be helpful. For seizures, clonazepam and gabapentin may be helpful. Unfortunately, many AEDs precipitate attacks, especially barbiturates, which should be avoided. HCP is caused by coproporphyrinogen oxidase deficiency, and VP is caused by protoporphyrinogen oxidase deficiency. In both, the neurovisceral manifestations are similar to AIP, but in HCP and VP, there are cutaneous manifestations with photosensitivity, abnormal skin fragility, and bullous skin lesions on sun-exposed areas. HCP and VP cause increased urinary and fecal levels of coproporphyrin III. Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. 18th ed.

Given the severely reduced HDL level, cholesteryl esters accumulate in various tissues, including tonsils, peripheral nerves, cornea, bone marrow, and other organs of the reticuloendothelial system. A typical clinical finding is the enlarged orange tonsils. Peripheral neuropathy is common and manifests with sensory loss to pain and temperature that may have a pattern in the upper extremities similar to that seen in syringomyelia, or may affect the entire body. Motor involvement may manifest with weakness that affects the upper and lower extremities and particularly the hand muscles. A symmetric polyneuropathy is common; however, a mononeuropathy presentation can also be seen. Deep tendon reflexes are depressed. Cranial nerves may also be involved. Premature atherosclerosis also occurs. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of clinical features and a lipid profile showing HDL deficiency, with low total cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. Foamy macrophages are present in the bone marrow and other tissues. There is no specific treatment. Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. 18th ed.

      "explicacao": "Menkes disease, also known as kinky hair syndrome, is a disorder of intracellular copper transport characterized by the presence of brittle coarse and lightly pigmented hair (pili torti), hyperelastic 1260 skin, and thin or absent eyebrows. Neurologic manifestations include seizures, severe developmental delay, cerebral vasculopathy with tortuous and kinked intra and extracranial vessels, progressive cerebral atrophy, and subdural hematomas and/or hygromas. Other organ systems are involved, including the skeletal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract. Abnormal fullness of the cheeks, osteoporosis, and metaphyseal dysplasia are often seen. Cephalohematomas and spontaneous bone fractures are seen in newborns, which may raise the suspicion for nonaccidental trauma. In the classic presentation, patients present in the first months of life with hypotonia, hypothermia, failure to thrive, neurologic regression with severe developmental delay, and psychomotor retardation and seizures, with rapid progression and death by the third or fourth year of life. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder resulting from a mutation in ATP7A (Xq21.1), a copper transporter, resulting in defective copper transport across the intestines and across the blood–brain barrier, with low levels of copper in the plasma, liver, and brain. Various enzymes require copper as a cofactor, including cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, and lysyl oxidase among others. Histopathologically, the cortex, thalamus, and subcortical nuclei demonstrate loss of neurons and gliosis. The cerebellum shows loss of granular neurons and Purkinje cells. Laboratory studies demonstrate low serum levels of ceruloplasmin and copper. The presence of subdural hematomas in an infant may raise question of nonaccidental injury, although the cutaneous findings and other manifestations allow the distinction to be made. Menkes disease is a disorder of copper deficiency in the liver and the brain, unlike Wilson’s disease, a disorder of copper accumulation in these organs, which is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in the ATP7B gene (13q14).

The most common mutation is in the mtDNA MTTL1 gene encoding for an mtDNA tRNA. The onset is often between 2 and 10 years of age, although symptoms may begin at any age, including adulthood. Patients are normal at birth, later manifesting with seizures, migraine headaches, vomiting with anorexia, exercise intolerance, and weakness. Failure to thrive, growth retardation, and progressive deafness are common in these children. Stroke-like episodes occur, presenting with transient hemiparesis, cortical blindness, and altered consciousness, with cumulative residual effects leading to gradually progressive neurologic impairment, cognitive deterioration and encephalopathy. The MRI shown in Figure 14.23 demonstrates multifocal infarcts that do not correlate with definite vascular territories. Initially, the infarcts occur in the posterior cerebral regions, with eventual involvement of other cerebral and cerebellar cortices, basal ganglia, and the thalamus. The infarcts are extremely epileptogenic. Lactate level is elevated in the blood and CSF. Muscle biopsy may demonstrate ragged red fibers. There is no specific treatment. These patients may have some benefit from coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine.

      "explicacao": "In patients with HIV aseptic meningitis, alertness and cognition are preserved, distinguishing it from encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Acute HIV aseptic meningitis is a syndrome that may occur during the initial stages of HIV infection as part of the seroconversion syndrome. Patients with acute HIV meningitis present with a febrile illness, headache, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. By definition, alertness and cognition are preserved. The CSF of these patients usually shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis (but usually less than 25 cells/ μ L) and mildly increased protein level (less than 100 mg/dL), with normal glucose levels. In a patient with HIV, meningitis due to HIV itself is a diagnosis of exclusion; an extensive evaluation to rule out other etiologies is mandatory, including other viruses, tuberculosis, fungi, bacteria, lymphoma or meningeal carcinomatosis, and other inflammatory conditions. The diagnosis is made once other etiologies have been ruled out in a patient with signs of meningeal irritation and confirmed HIV infection. However, this syndrome may occur at early stages of infection during which HIV antibodies may not be detected. In these cases, subsequent serologic testing for HIV is required later. Acute HIV meningitis requires no specific therapy and will eventually subside, although early initiation of treatment of antiretroviral therapy for the HIV infection itself is important. 1294 Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

This spirochete is transmitted by the deer tick Ixodes and is frequently seen in the northeast United States. Clinically, the disease manifests in three stages: • Stage 1 (localized infection) (within first 4 weeks of the tick bite): erythema chronicum migrans, which is a “bull’s eye rash” (not erythema marginatum, which is seen in rheumatic fever). Patients may have constitutional symptoms during this stage. • Stage 2 (disseminated infection) (days to weeks after the rash): systemic manifestations, with fever, chills, migratory musculoskeletal pain, arthralgias, fatigue. Cardiac involvement may also be present (cardiac conduction blocks). After weeks or months, some patients may develop lymphocytic meningitis, and neuropathies, including cranial and peripheral neuropathies. • Stage 3 (persistent infection) (months after the secondary stage): Intermittent episodes of oligoarthritis, encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, and dementia. An axonal polyneuropathy may also occur. The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on epidemiologic data, clinical information, and CSF and serologic studies. The presence of anti– B. burgdorferi antibodies in the serum and CSF, with intrathecal production of these antibodies, are helpful in making the diagnosis. PCR is also available. MRI studies may show leptomeningeal enhancement in some cases. Patients with CNS abnormalities should be treated with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone or penicillin G for up to 2 to 4 weeks. If CSF findings are unremarkable and there are no neurologic manifestations or cardiac involvement, oral doxycycline may be sufficient.

      "explicacao": "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (or AIDS-dementia complex) is a complication of HIV typically occurring at late stages 1296 of the disease. The spectrum of this cognitive disorder includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), minor neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Usually, HAD is seen in patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3, with a diagnosis of AIDS. The etiology of this condition is the retrovirus itself rather than an opportunistic infection. Progressive cognitive decline and prominent psychomotor dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations. These patients have significant difficulties with attention and concentration, along with fine motor dysfunction, gait incoordination, and tremors. However, focal neurologic deficits are not common. CSF analysis is nonspecific, frequently revealing mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and slightly elevated protein levels. Neuropathological studies show diffuse white matter pallor, mononuclear infiltrates, multinucleated giant cells, and vacuolar changes in the brain. The main findings are in the subcortical region, and the cerebral cortex is relatively spared. Neuropsychologic testing is useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of these patients, as well as to monitor them while on therapy. HIV-associated dementia can be prevented by adequate early treatment of HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with the goals of attaining higher CD4 counts and suppressing the virus. Treatment of patients with HIV-associated dementia leads to improvements in neuropsychological performance. However, the prognosis is generally poor, likely given the late stage of HIV in which this condition develops. Given the cognitive impairment of these patients, successful treatment requires the use of simpler HAART regimens, with the least number of drugs and simple dosing intervals, and using a regimen that minimizes side effects. Complex regimens are associated with poor compliance. Family or friend support is very important, and directly observed therapy may be required. Besides HAART, there are no other specific therapies for HIV-associated dementia. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Furthermore, the histopathologic specimen demonstrates budding yeasts near blood vessels and surrounded by an inflammatory infiltrate, which is consistent with infection by this organism. Cryptococcal meningitis usually occurs in immunocompromised patients and is an opportunistic infection seen in advanced HIV 1298 infection, usually when CD4 counts fall below 100 cells/ μ L. However, it may rarely be seen in otherwise immunocompetent patients. Patients usually present with fever, headache, neck stiffness, personality and behavioral changes, and altered mental status. Brain CT scan and MRI are performed to rule out other conditions and may demonstrate hydrocephalus, gelatinous pseudocysts, infarcts, or cryptococcomas. Lumbar puncture demonstrates an increased opening pressure, and CSF analysis shows mononuclear lymphocytosis with increased protein and low glucose levels. India ink smear is not very sensitive; however, it is useful when it is positive. Cryptococcal antigen detection in the CSF is rapid, sensitive and specific, and clinically useful, since fungal culture may take several days to weeks for a positive result to be obtained. The initial treatment regimen is amphotericin plus flucytosine for 2 to 3 weeks. These patients should be monitored closely, since amphotericin is associated with renal failure, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia; and flucytosine may cause hematologic abnormalities. If the patient is doing well on amphotericin and flucytosine, or the meningitis is mild, the treatment can be switched to fluconazole 200 mg twice daily for 8 to 10 weeks. Afterward, the patient should be kept on long-term maintenance therapy with fluconazole 200 mg daily to prevent recurrences. Highly active antiretroviral therapy, by promoting immune reconstitution, plays a major role in the long-term treatment of HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis, after the acute infection has cleared. Mortality rate in the acute setting may be related to elevated intracranial pressure, which should be treated. Patients with increased intracranial pressure may need frequent CSF drainage by repeated lumbar punctures or even ventriculostomy. Since this patient does not have a bacterial or tuberculous meningitis, there is no role for vancomycin, ceftriaxone, isoniazid, or rifampin. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient has toxoplasmosis of the CNS, which is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular protozoan. The diagnosis in this case can be suspected based on the history and clinical findings and confirmed with the histopathologic findings showing a microglial nodule, in which an encysted bradyzoite can be seen surrounded by an inflammatory infiltrate. Toxoplasmosis is a frequent central nervous system opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, especially those not properly treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. The organism is usually acquired earlier in life and remains dormant until the immune system declines and T. gondii becomes active. This occurs in advanced stages of immunodeficiency in the setting of CD4 counts of less than 100/ μ L. Patients present with headaches, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and altered mental status that in late stages can progress to coma. Brain MRI typically demonstrates multiple ring enhancing lesions with surrounding edema. Since these cases present with a mass lesion in the brain, the differential diagnoses include primary CNS lymphoma, tuberculomas, fungal masses, or bacterial abscesses. Definitive diagnosis is made with brain biopsy; however, this is not commonly performed, and patients are typically treated empirically. Standard therapy is sulfadiazine plus pyrimethamine. Since both agents affect the folate metabolism pathways, folinic acid should be provided to avoid hematologic complications. An alternative therapy is clindamycin, especially in patients who are allergic to the sulfa components and cannot take sulfadiazine. Long-term suppressive therapy is needed to prevent relapses. Highly active antiretroviral therapy promotes immune reconstitution, and patients whose CD4 counts rise above 200/ μ L may not need further suppressive therapy. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used for prophylaxis. Patients with HIV and CD4 counts of less than 100/ μ L with positive IgG antibodies to toxoplasma should be given prophylaxis. 1300 Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient has primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) in the setting of AIDS. These patients usually present with focal neurologic manifestations, which progress slowly over days to weeks. Since PCNSL in AIDS patients is frequently associated with Epstein–Barr virus, positive CSF PCR for this virus helps to make the diagnosis. CSF findings usually demonstrate a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low to normal glucose levels. Cytology may detect atypical cells; however, this test has low sensitivity. Flow cytometry is helpful in making the diagnosis showing monoclonal B lymphocytes. CT scan has poor sensitivity, and MRI is a better tool, showing one or more lesions usually in the periventricular and deep regions of the brain. These lesions may have contrast enhancement, surrounding edema, and produce mass effect. Definitive diagnosis is done with brain biopsy. Corticosteroids are helpful in the treatment of edema and mass effect, and the lesion itself tends to shrink with this treatment. However, the use of steroids may alter the results and the sensitivity of the brain biopsy. Whenever possible, their use should be delayed until after the biopsy is obtained. The use of chemotherapy is controversial in this setting, and may not be optimal in patients with a baseline poor performance status related to the underlying disease. Radiation therapy is used as palliative treatment. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy has improved the overall prognosis in patients with AIDS and PCNSL.

      "explicacao": "This patient has progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JC virus, which is a polyomavirus. PML occurs in patients with end-stage AIDS. A large percentage of the general population has antibodies against this virus, certainly without 1301 clinical manifestations; and therefore, the presence of serum antibodies is not helpful for the diagnosis. Only those patients with severe immunosuppression develop clinical manifestations; PML in immunocompetent individuals is exceedingly rare but can occur. PML is a demyelinating condition and presents with a gradually progressive course of multiple focal neurologic manifestations, with visual field deficits and visual agnosias being common, given the predominant involvement of parieto-occipital regions. Hemiparesis, sensory deficits, language disorders and ataxia may occur. The diagnosis can be suspected with the history and clinical manifestations, supported with MRI findings and CSF JC virus DNA PCR, and confirmed with brain biopsy (though brain biopsy is not necessary in the setting of typical clinical, imaging, and CSF findings). MRI shows multiple white matter nonenhancing lesions that tend to coalesce and predominate in the parieto-occipital regions. Brain biopsy is the gold standard diagnostic test; neuropathologic findings include myelin loss, giant astrocytes, and altered oligodendrocytes, with enlarged nuclei and viral inclusions. On electronic microscopy, the viral particles give a “spaghetti and meatballs” appearance. The specimen shown in Figure 15.3 demonstrates enlarged oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusions consistent with PML. CSF JC virus DNA PCR is specific for the diagnosis, and brain biopsy is rarely necessary when this test is positive. Patients with PML have poor prognosis, as it denotes the presence of an already severely altered immune system. There is no specific therapy for this condition; however, some patients may improve with antiretroviral therapy and immune reconstitution. There are no specific EEG findings in PML, and acyclovir does not treat this condition. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

      "explicacao": "This patient has HIV neuropathy, which is a distal sensory neuropathy seen in patients with HIV, more frequently as the CD4 count drops. This condition is a predominantly sensory, axonal length-dependent symmetric polyneuropathy. It is thought to be related to direct effects of the virus and cytokine upregulation. These patients should continue antiretroviral therapy for virus suppression, and the treatment is symptomatic for the neuropathic pain. Options b to e mention other types of neuropathy that can be seen in patients with HIV. Nucleoside analog-associated neuropathy occurs over weeks following the initiation of therapy, and the treatment is to discontinue the offending drug. In the patient depicted in this question, the symptoms of neuropathy had evolved over months and not in direct relationship with initiation of the antiretrovirals; therefore, it is most likely that she has HIV neuropathy. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy can occur secondary to dysregulation of the immune system and is seen most frequently at the time of seroconversion. Cytomegalovirus polyradiculomyelitis is an uncommon syndrome seen in patients with very low CD4 counts, presenting with leg pain, sensory symptoms, and weakness, along with areflexia and sphincteric dysfunction evolving over days. Mononeuropathy multiplex can occur with HIV disease, more frequently late in the course of the illness, and may be associated with superimposed infection, lymphomatous infiltration, or vasculitis. However, clinically, this case does not represent a mononeuropathy multiplex, but rather a distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "Bacterial meningitis can be caused by different groups of bacteria, depending on the age group, risk factors, and associated circumstances. Escherichia coli, other enteric gram-negative bacilli, Listeria monocytogenes, and group B streptococci are the most common pathogens of bacterial meningitis in neonates. In patients from 1 to 23 months of age, the most common agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. In patients in the 2 to 50 years age group, the most common agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. In older adults, such as the patient depicted in question 18, Listeria monocytogenes should be considered, as well as aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Neurosurgical patients are predisposed to meningitis with aerobic gram-negative bacilli (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa ), Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus coagulase negative (such as epidermidis). In the setting of CNS instrumentation, these same agents and Propionibacterium acnes should be considered. Unlike in community- acquired meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae is not a common cause of hospital-acquired meningitis. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be started early and before specific organisms can be identified from CSF cultures. Usually, vancomycin and a third-generation cephalosporin (such as 1304 ceftriaxone) are initiated in adult patients with suspicion for bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and/or Haemophilus influenzae. In the extremes of life (younger and older patients) and in immunocompromised patients, Listeria monocytogenes should be considered and, therefore, ampicillin should be added to the empiric therapy.

      "explicacao": "This patient has Hansen disease, or leprosy. This disease has a long incubation period (from years to decades) and is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which is thought to spread through the respiratory tract but does not typically produce a respiratory illness. This mycobacterium has tropism toward peripheral nerves, especially in cooler areas of the body. Leprosy has two major variants, a lepromatous variant and a tuberculoid variant, in addition to intermediate forms between the two. The lepromatous variant occurs in patients with impaired cell- mediated immunity, making it possible for the organism to spread to the skin and peripheral nerves, causing a maculopapular rash, nodules, and poorly demarcated skin lesions. The manifestations can be systemic, and patients present with sensory loss predominantly in the coolest regions of the body, such as the pinna of the ear, tip of the nose, dorsal surfaces of the hands, forearms and feet, and dorsolateral surface of the legs. The tuberculoid form occurs in patients with good cellular immunity, in which the disease is less disseminated, the skin lesions are better localized, and the patient will also have asymmetric peripheral neuropathies with thickened nerves. The ulnar nerve is commonly affected, and the syndrome may resemble mononeuritis multiplex. Other commonly involved nerves include the greater auricular, radial, common peroneal, and sural nerves. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical and epidemiologic data. Skin and/or nerve biopsies are often necessary, demonstrating inflammatory granulomas with epithelioid and mononuclear infiltrates and acid-fast organisms. Chronic therapy is usually needed, using rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine. As opposed to tuberculosis, pulmonary illness is uncommon in Hansen disease. Nocardia asteroides stains partially acid-fast; however, it is associated with respiratory infections, cutaneous 1307 abscesses and fistulas, and sometimes cerebral abscesses, but not peripheral neuropathies.

These lesions originate from invasion of brain parenchyma by bacterial organisms, commonly polymicrobial, with a combination of 1308 streptococci, staphylococci, enterobacteria, and anaerobes. The bacterial agents spread via hematogenous routes or from a contiguous infected site, such as the sinuses, ears, or teeth. They also can be encountered after open trauma or neurosurgical interventions. Patients may present with fever, headaches, neck stiffness, focal neurologic findings, and altered mental status. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical suspicion and the presence of risk factors, along with clinical and radiologic findings, with the MRI showing ring enhancing lesions with surrounding edema. Lumbar puncture may be contraindicated in the presence of mass effect, and therefore CSF may not be available. The presence of atypical lymphocytes and monoclonal B cells in the CSF are seen in lymphoproliferative disorders and not in brain abscesses. Brain abscesses evolve through different stages, with initial cerebritis in the first few days, then the formation of central necrosis with surrounding vasogenic edema, and the subsequent formation of a capsule. The abscess eventually matures, with the development of collagenous tissue in the capsule and regression of the vasogenic edema. Caseating granulomas are not seen in cerebral bacterial abscesses. Optimal treatment requires drainage of the abscess in combination with intravenous antibiotics. Given that these lesions are most commonly polymicrobial, the treatment of choice is a combination of antibiotics, usually a third-generation cephalosporin (for streptococci and gram-negative bacilli), metronidazole (for anaerobes), and vancomycin (for staphylococci). The IV antibiotic regimen is continued for 6 to 8 weeks, and subsequent continuous oral antibiotics may be required beyond the initial treatment period. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used for cerebral toxoplasmosis, which is not the diagnosis in this patient. Antiretroviral therapy plays no role in the treatment of cerebral abscesses. These lesions are not typically caused by mycobacteria. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2012."

This diagnosis is suspected on the basis of his epidemiologic factors, clinical findings, and CSF findings and confirmed with the leptomeningeal biopsy, which demonstrates a granulomatous inflammatory response with multinucleated giant cells and caseating necrosis, as seen in Figure 15.5 . TB meningitis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is an aerobic mycobacterium that spreads via respiratory droplets leading to a primary infection (usually pulmonary) and subsequent reactivation (commonly in the setting of immunosuppression). TB meningitis tends to affect the base of the brain and frequently presents with fever, headache, neck stiffness, multiple cranial neuropathies (due to involvement of the basal aspect of the brain) 1310 and altered mental status. Focal neurologic manifestations and seizures may also occur. CSF demonstrates elevated protein level, low glucose level, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Opening pressure is usually elevated but may be normal. Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear is diagnostic in 10% to 30% of the cases, and CSF cultures may be positive in 45% to 70%; however, the results may take between 6 and 8 weeks to become positive. PCR has higher sensitivity and may be helpful to make a diagnosis earlier. Brain MRI may be normal or may demonstrate meningeal enhancement, especially on the basal surface. Pathologic specimens show caseating granulomas, mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, and multinucleated giant cells as described in this case. Combinations of multiple anti-TB agents are used to kill the organisms and avoid inducing resistance. Commonly used medications are isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Usually, four drugs are initially administered for 2 months, after which the regimen can be reduced to two drugs that can be continued for several months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can affect the spinal cord and the brain parenchyma, where it can lead to the formation of tuberculomas. These lesions behave like space-occupying lesions, and the treatment is with anti-TB medications. Peripheral nerves are more commonly affected by Mycobacterium leprae rather than Mycobacterium tuberculosis; in leprosy, nerve thickening occurs, often with multiple mononeuropathies pattern (discussed in questions 29–30).

      "explicacao": "This patient has Hansen disease, which is the cause of her neuropathy. Hansen disease, or leprosy, is caused by 1311 Mycobacterium leprae and is an important cause of neuropathy and skin disease worldwide. Most cases in the United States occur in immigrants, especially from Asia, the South Pacific, India, South America, and certain parts of Africa. Mycobacterium leprae is transmitted after prolonged and close contact with a patient with the disease, with an incubation period that is very long, lasting for years. The organism is thought to spread through the respiratory tract, from where it disseminates to other regions, especially the skin and superficial nerves, and mainly to cooler regions of the body. When invading the peripheral nerves, the mycobacterium tends to involve the Schwann cells preferentially. There are two main variants determined by the immune reaction against this mycobacterium, and these variants are the tuberculoid and lepromatous forms. In between these, there are three borderline variants: borderline tuberculoid, borderline intermediate, and borderline lepromatous forms. The tuberculoid variant presents in patients with strong cell-mediated immunity and an intense delayed hypersensitivity reaction, causing destruction of peripheral nerves and inflammatory lesions in the skin. These patients typically have demarcated hypopigmented lesions and areas of sensory loss, especially to temperature and pinprick. Peripheral nerves are involved, indurated, hypertrophic, and palpable, and sensory loss may be prominent, leading to trauma. Nerves predominantly involved are the ulnar, radial, common peroneal, sural, and greater auricular. Claw-hand from ulnar involvement and footdrop from common peroneal involvement may be present. The lepromatous form is present in patients with poor cell- mediated immunity with proliferation of the mycobacteria as they invade the tissues. It is characterized by skin infiltration by the mycobacteria, leading to diffuse cutaneous involvement in the coolest regions such as the pinna of the ear, tip of the nose, and dorsum of the hands and feet. Nerves may also be involved but usually at later stages. The treatment of Hansen disease is prolonged, usually with a combination of dapsone and rifampin, sometimes with the addition of clofazimine.

Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum, which transmits vertically from mother to child or via sexual contact. In infected adults, three phases with a latent period and various neurologic complications are described: • Primary syphilis is characterized by the development of a painless chancre at the site of entry (genital region). There is asymptomatic systemic spread of the organism, and the chancre eventually disappears. • Secondary syphilis develops approximately 2 to 12 weeks after the exposure, with manifestations of systemic dissemination, including constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and rash (classically palms and soles). Syphilitic meningitis and cranial neuropathies may occur in this second stage. • Latent period is an asymptomatic phase with serologic evidence of the disease, which may last for years. • Tertiary syphilis is characterized by cardiovascular complications (such as aortitis), gummatous complications, and neurologic complications. Major neurologic complications include pure meningeal syphilis, meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, and parenchymatous neurosyphilis. Meningeal invasion of the treponemes can lead to meningitis and meningovascular syphilis, in which there is endarteritis obliterans and vasculitis, which can lead to strokes in different arterial distributions; this can occur at any stage but often occurs within the first 4 to 7 years of infection with syphilis. Tabes dorsalis is the classical myelopathy with areflexia, lightning pains, 1313 sensory ataxia, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and relatively preserved strength, leading to gait instability and the development of Charcot joints. Parenchymatous syphilis (general paresis) is the encephalitic form in which patients develop progressive dementia, neuropsychiatric manifestations, speech disturbance, and pupillary abnormalities. Argyll-Robertson pupils, which accommodate but do not react to light, may be seen in patients with neurosyphilis.

Patients with CJD present clinically with a rapidly progressive dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cerebellar ataxia, and myoclonus. These patients deteriorate rapidly and inexorably die within months. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of clinical features and supported by ancillary tests such as MRI, EEG, and CSF studies.

However, not all the cases of untreated syphilis progress to the subsequent stages, and only a small percentage of patients with untreated syphilis will develop symptomatic neurosyphilis. The diagnosis of syphilis is based on clinical manifestations along with supportive laboratory evidence. There are treponemal and nontreponemal tests. Nontreponemal tests are the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the Rapid Plasma Reagin test. These tests are more sensitive but less specific than treponemal tests and become negative sometime after treatment. Treponemal antibodies remain positive for life and include the fluorescent treponemal antibody and microhemagglutination assay among others. For the diagnosis of neurosyphilis, CSF should be analyzed, usually showing mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein levels. CSF VDRL is very specific for neurosyphilis but may be negative in as many as 25% of cases. Intrathecal antibody production against Treponema pallidum, oligoclonal bands, and PCR are also helpful for the diagnosis. Treatment of neurosyphilis involves intravenous antibiotics, and the first choice is penicillin G 4 million units every 4 hours for 14 days. Antibiotic therapy may clear the infection; however, it may not reverse already established neurologic manifestations of tertiary syphilis.

This leads to physico-chemical changes in the protein, making it resistant to proteinases, poorly soluble, and with a tendency to polymerize, which eventually may lead to neuronal death. PrPSc has the ability to bind to PrPC and induce its conformational change, therefore making this agent infective. CJD can be sporadic or familial, caused by mutations in the prion protein gene. The familial form can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. EEG is helpful in making the diagnosis, showing a repetitive sharp and wave periodic pattern. CJD is not necessarily associated with compromised immunity, and therefore does not depend on CD4 counts.

The new variant CJD was first described in 1996 and is believed to occur from infection through consumption of cattle products contaminated with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In contrast to traditional forms of CJD, new variant CJD affects younger patients (third to fourth decades of life), and the duration is more protracted. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

Measles can cause four major neurologic syndromes: • Acute encephalitis. • Postviral encephalomyelitis. • Measles inclusion body encephalitis, which occurs in patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiency, 1 to 6 months after measles exposure. It is characterized by a rapidly progressive dementing process with seizures, myoclonus, mental status changes, and coma. • SSPE, which is caused by defective measles virus maturation in neural cells. Children infected in the first 2 years of life are the ones at the greatest risk for SSPE, which may develop 2 to 12 years after the infection. It begins with behavioral and personality changes, later causing seizures, myoclonus, spasticity, ataxia, choreoathetoid movements, optic atrophy, quadriparesis, autonomic instability, akinetic mutism, and eventually coma. EEG shows periodic slow-wave complexes at regular intervals and a background of depressed activity. MRI demonstrates T2 1320 hyperintensity in the gray and subcortical white matter more in the posterior regions. Neuropathologically, neurons contain nuclear and cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies, and levels of CSF and serum antibodies are elevated. Regarding the arboviruses, these are arthropod-borne viruses, transmitted by mosquitoes. More than 500 arbovirus-transmitted RNA viruses exist, including Saint Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, La Crosse encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Eastern and Western Equine encephalitis viruses.

This organism is capable of causing various manifestations, such as allergic syndromes, respiratory tract infections, and sinusitis. However, it may also cause an invasive syndrome that can spread to the CNS, especially in neutropenic patients, immunocompromised patients, or those chronically on steroids. Aspergillus fumigatus is the organism that causes most of the invasive syndromes, invading blood vessels, causing stroke-like syndromes, infarcts, and hemorrhagic transformation. A vasculitis- type phenomenon occurs as the fungus invades the vessel walls and may eventually progress to parenchymal disease, forming granulomas, and abscesses. This fungus may invade multiple other organs and cause systemic disease. Histopathologically, invading hyphae are detected in blood vessels, with the findings of necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation. The specimen shown in Figure 15.8 is a Gomori methenamine silver stain demonstrating septate hyphae that branch at acute angles, which is consistent with aspergillus infection. Aspergillosis does not typically present with meningitis. Cryptococcus causes meningitis and not typically a vasculitis-type syndrome. Histoplasmosis causes pulmonary disease more frequently, but when it invades the CNS, it can produce a form of basilar meningitis, focal cerebritis, or granulomas.

Neurocysticercosis is caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium and has a worldwide distribution, being endemic in Latin America, Africa, India, and other parts of Asia. Human ingestion of undercooked pork meat containing cysticerci may lead to infection with the intestinal tapeworms but does not cause the manifestations of neurocysticercosis, which occurs only with infection at a specific stage of the tapeworm life cycle. When the adult tapeworm resides in the small bowel of either the pig or the human, proglottids are released and excreted in to the feces. The eggs in these proglottids are infective to humans and animals. After humans ingest these eggs, larvae are released which penetrate the intestinal wall, migrating to various tissues, causing cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis. Clinical manifestations may occur years later, including seizures, focal neurologic symptoms, a vasculitic-type syndrome with strokes, increased intracranial pressure, headaches, hydrocephalus, and rarely coma. Neuroimaging is helpful in the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis, showing cystic lesions that may have contrast enhancement and calcifications. The treatment of choice is albendazole. Praziquantel is an alternative. Since patients commonly have seizures, antiepileptic agents are often required. Taenia saginata is the beef tapeworm but does not cause neurocysticercosis. India ink is used to detect Cryptococcus but is not useful in 1322 cysticercosis. Cysticercosis is not transmitted by flies.

The diagnosis is based on clinical history and epidemiological factors and is confirmed by the histopathologic specimen, which shows an inflammatory infiltrate and trophozoites, consistent with an amebic infection. Amebic meningoencephalitis is caused by free-living amebae, such as Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba, and Balamuthia mandrillaris. Patients acquire the amebae by swimming in contaminated lakes or ponds. The parasites enter the brain by passing through the cribriform plate and along the olfactory nerve to enter the frontal lobes and cause a necrotizing inflammation with destruction. Acanthamoeba can also enter the CNS through hematogenous dissemination and from a primary corneal infection acquired by using contact lenses stored in contaminated solution. Patients with amebic encephalitis present with headaches, fever, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting and eventually develop focal neurologic findings, seizures, and altered mental status. The progression is rapid, and the disease is usually fatal. CSF opening pressure is increased, and CSF analysis shows a neutrophilic pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose levels. Gram stain will not show the organism, but trophozoites may be seen on a wet preparation of unspun spinal fluid.

It is more commonly acquired in the Northeastern United States and is transmitted by a tick bite, more specifically the Ixodes tick. Lyme disease has an early phase and a late phase, and neurologic complications occur in both. In the early phase, patients may have a rash called erythema migrans, which is characteristic and has a “bull’s eye” appearance. Other nonneurologic manifestations include carditis, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, and fever. Neurologic manifestations in the early phase include the following: • Aseptic meningitis: these patients have a mononuclear pleocytosis and mild elevation of protein levels in the CSF, as well as intrathecal production of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. • Cranial neuropathy: commonly cranial nerve VII, and this can be uni- or bilateral. • Peripheral nervous system: including mononeuritis multiplex, peripheral neuropathy, polyradiculopathy, or even a Guillain– Barré type presentation (which is not common). Neurologic presentations in the late phase are encephalopathy, encephalomyelitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Bacterial meningitis with neutrophilic predominance is unlikely to occur. Subdural empyema is not seen in Lyme disease. The diagnosis of CNS Lyme disease is based on clinical and epidemiological suspicion, supported by the presence of positive serology, CSF abnormalities, and intrathecal production of 1324 antibodies. Serology may be positive in small percentage of people living in endemic areas, and this should be taken into account. The treatment is antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone, up to 2 g daily for 2 to 4 weeks. For late presentations, a longer course may be required.

On FLAIR sequence, the hyperintense region of edema is well appreciated surrounding the lesion. Other ring-enhancing brain lesions can be considered in the differential diagnosis. However, brain abscesses characteristically exhibit restricted diffusion (as shown in the diffusion-weighted MRI), which helps differentiate them from other brain lesions such as metastatic or primary brain tumors. Cerebritis represents an early stage of the infectious process in the brain which can progress to brain abscess formation. On neuroimaging, cerebritis is often a poorly defined lesion, which can be hyperintense on T2, and hypo- or isointense on T1, with irregular and variable contrast enhancement.

Chickenpox is caused by VZV primary infection, and after this, the virus remains latent in dorsal root ganglia, autonomic ganglia, and cranial nerve ganglia. The virus reactivates years later producing various neurologic manifestations: • Herpes zoster: Occurs more commonly in older patients, and in those with some degree of immunodeficiency, but can occur in anyone. Usually starts with hyperesthesia, tingling and burning sensation in the involved dermatomes (usually one to three dermatomes), followed by the zoster rash, which is a vesicular rash in that same region. The rash gradually heals over several days, but patients experience pain and sensory impairment that can last weeks to months. The most commonly involved dermatomes are in the mid-thoracic region. • Zoster sine herpete: In this variant, the patient experiences the sensory symptoms without the rash. • Herpes zoster ophthalmicus: This involves reactivation of the virus in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, and causing sensory symptoms and rash in the distribution of this nerve division. In this distribution, the cornea and conjunctiva can be involved, causing keratitis, which can lead to blindness. • Ramsay–Hunt syndrome: Characterized by facial palsy combined with herpetic rash in the external auditory meatus, sometimes with vertigo, tinnitus, and deafness. This syndrome is secondary to geniculate ganglion involvement. • Other cranial nerves can be affected by reactivation of the virus, with various cranial neuropathies resulting from this. • Necrotizing retinitis leading to visual loss. • VZV vasculopathy: Small and large intracranial vessels are involved, leading to ischemic strokes, TIAs, and sometimes aneurysmal dilatations with resulting subarachnoid or intracranial hemorrhages.

CSF may be abnormal, with mild mononuclear pleocytosis, slightly elevated protein but normal glucose levels. Virologic confirmation is required, and the value of detecting anti-VZV IgG in the CSF has been demonstrated to be superior to the detection of VZV DNA. Even though a positive VZV DNA in the CSF is helpful, a negative PCR does not exclude the diagnosis.

Patients with infective endocarditis can have a variety of neurologic complications, most likely from embolization of infected particles from the valvular vegetations. These neurologic manifestations include ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, meningitis, encephalitis, abscesses, vasculitis, and mycotic aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if they rupture. The exact mechanism of formation of mycotic aneurysms is not well known, but it is likely that they form secondary to septic emboli involving distal vessels, affecting their vasa vasorum, with destruction and weakening of the arterial wall and subsequent aneurysmal dilatation. These mycotic aneurysms are usually very distal in the arterial tree, and commonly seen in distal bifurcations. They are not typically seen in the proximal circle of Willis. The subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from rupture of these small aneurysms is usually cortical and superficial, and is not generally associated with vasospasm. Patients who suffer subarachnoid hemorrhage in the setting of infective endocarditis, should have a diagnostic cerebral angiogram to evaluate for the presence of mycotic aneurysms (or other potential cause of the subarachnoid hemorrhage). Some advocate for cerebral angiogram in patients with endocarditis and ischemic strokes or other signs of neurologic involvement, since mycotic aneurysms may be silent, however, this practice is still not widely recommended. Ruptured mycotic aneurysms should be treated surgically or endovascularly. Patients with infective endocarditis should be properly treated with early antibiotic therapy, which is mainstay of treatment. Antibiotics not only treat the cardiac infection but also prevents neurologic complications, and may potentially lead to resolution of unruptured mycotic aneurysms. Anticoagulants are generally contraindicated given the risk of rupture of silent or known mycotic aneurysms, as well as potential risk of hemorrhagic transformation of embolic strokes.

Headaches and encephalopathy also occur, often as a symptom of the latter complications. Septic cerebral emboli can lead to mycotic aneurysms by causing intraluminal arterial wall necrosis (due to arteritis) and destruction of the adventitia and muscularis with subsequent dilatation. Mycotic aneurysms are usually located at distal arterial bifurcations and are best detected by conventional cerebral angiography. Because of increased risk of hemorrhagic conversion, anticoagulation in patients with ischemic stroke due to infective endocarditis is warranted only in specific cases such as in patients with mechanical valves. 1350 The mainstay of therapy for the neurologic complications of infective endocarditis is antibiotic therapy and acute symptomatic management (such as AEDs in patients with seizures). In certain cases of mycotic aneurysms, endovascular embolization or surgical resection may be indicated, especially in the setting of acute hemorrhage, and those patients requiring anticoagulation and/or open heart surgery. Neurologic complications occur in both patients with native and prosthetic valve endocarditis in a similar proportion. In those with prosthetic valves, those with mechanical valves may have more complications than those with bioprosthetic valves. Left-sided endocarditis is associated with higher risk of neurologic complications as compared to right-sided cases. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA. Aminoff’s Neurology and General Medicine. 5th ed.

The pathophysiology of ischemic strokes in these patients is not completely understood, with sickling and increased viscosity likely playing a significant role. However, large-vessel intracranial stenosis and/or occlusions are also frequently encountered, sometimes with Moyamoya-like appearance. Neurologic complications of Hb SS disease include ischemic 1351 stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial neuropathies, spinal cord infarction (although rare), intracranial aneurysm formation with subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic optic neuropathy, optic atrophy, seizures, and headaches. Ischemic stroke is more common in children with Hb SS disease than in adults. In children, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography should be periodically performed, and when elevated velocities are detected, blood transfusion (or exchange transfusion) have been shown to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Blood transfusions or exchange transfusions are used with the goal of reducing the percentage of hemoglobin S, therefore reducing the percentage of red blood cells that can sickle. Patients with Hb SS disease are more likely than those with hemoglobin SC (Hb SC) disease to suffer from neurologic complications. Adams R, McKie V, Hsu L, et al.

      "explicacao": "The plasma cell dyscrasias include Waldenström macroglobulinemia (smoldering or symptomatic), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (smoldering or symptomatic), plasmacytomas (bone and extramedullary), primary amyloidosis, idiopathic Bence Jones proteinuria, among others. Neurologic complications of the plasma cell dyscrasias include a wide spectrum of manifestations. Neuropathy in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias can be due to infiltration of the peripheral nervous system by abnormal cells, amyloidosis, or a paraneoplastic 1352 syndrome. Infiltration of peripheral nerves would typically cause a sensorimotor predominantly axonal neuropathy. Infiltration of vertebral bodies can be extensive enough to lead to nerve root as well as spinal cord compression. Patients with plasma cell dyscrasias may develop encephalopathy due to hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity syndrome (due to hypergammaglobulinemia), and CNS infections, which such patients are prone to due to their immunocompromised state. Direct CNS involvement in plasma cell dyscrasias can occur but is relatively rare. POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes) is a constellation of abnormalities seen in some patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, particularly plasmacytoma, and not with leukemias. Question 3 depicts a patient with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy associated with antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Patients with MGUS (which is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the absence of significant bone marrow involvement, anemia, renal failure, lytic lesions, or hypercalcemia) are at risk of developing symptomatic multiple myeloma. However, MGUS without evidence of other hematologic disorders can be associated with neuropathy. The neuropathy is often primarily demyelinating, and in some cases, particularly in patients with IgM MGUS, antibodies against MAG are detected in the serum. Neuropathy in patients with monoclonal proteinemias can also occur because of the presence of cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins are serum protein complexes that precipitate at specific temperatures. They occur in a variety of conditions as follows: Type I cryoglobulins are isolated monoclonal proteins (usually IgM) seen in the monoclonal paraproteinemias such as multiple myeloma and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Type II cryoglobulins are polyclonal immunocomplexes (formed by monoclonal IgM and IgG), usually seen in lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders, and Hepatitis C virus infection. Type III cryoglobulins are polyclonal immunocomplexes (formed by polyclonal IgM and IgG) seen with underlying infectious and autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis). The 1353 most common neuropathic complication of cryoglobulinemia is generalized neuropathy, although mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex and cerebral vasculitis with ischemic stroke can also occur. While Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease can present in adulthood, it is unlikely in the absence of family history or other evidence of a hereditary neuropathy on examination (discussed in Chapter 9 ), and a costly genetic panel would not be of high yield. A technetium bone scan is not useful in investigating for the presence of bone lesions due to multiple myeloma (rather, plane film radiographs are used). Anti-GQ1b antibodies are typically seen in the Miller– Fisher variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome (discussed in Chapter 9 ). Genetic abnormalities of superoxide dismutase are detected in some patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (discussed in Chapter 11 ), which is not the diagnosis in this case.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s laboratory studies point to the presence of hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. Given her presentation with a seizure, her history is consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The diagnostic pentad of TTP includes a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, low platelet counts, renal dysfunction, neurologic signs or symptoms, and fever, although not all five features may necessarily be present. TTP results from a deficiency of von Willebrand factor– cleaving protease, leading to abnormal platelet aggregation. Neurologic manifestations include seizures, headaches, encephalopathy, and in severe cases coma, cranial neuropathies, and focal neurologic deficits. Treatment includes emergency plasma exchange. 1354 Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) shares several features with TTP but HUS is associated with more severe renal dysfunction. It is predominantly a disorder of childhood, often associated with an infection with Shiga toxin–producing bacteria such as certain strains of Escherichia coli and Shigella. The syndrome is typically preceded by abdominal pain and diarrhea, not present in the case depicted in this question. Seizures, encephalopathy, cranial nerve palsies, and neuropathy may occur. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura does not typically have primary neurologic manifestations (unless intracranial bleeding occurs, which is rare even with markedly low platelet levels), and it is not associated with a hemolytic anemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) results in a coagulopathy, along with other laboratory findings that may help distinguish it from TTP ( Table 16-1 ); in this patient, the coagulation tests were normal. Because DIC typically occurs in the setting of a severe illness, there is often associated encephalopathy, and seizures and other neurologic manifestations may complicate the underlying illness.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, or portosystemic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is seen in patients with liver cirrhosis of any cause (not only in those with alcoholic cirrhosis), and the extent of liver dysfunction, rather than the cause of cirrhosis, correlates with the degree of encephalopathy. Clinical manifestations are variable, ranging from mildly decreased attention, disorientation, and personality changes to somnolence and in severe cases coma. Asterixis, or negative myoclonus, is seen in hepatic encephalopathy and other metabolic encephalopathies. EEG findings include generalized slowing and triphasic waves (discussed also in Chapter 5 ). Although hyperammonemia has been largely associated with the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy, other abnormalities of neurotransmission are also implicated, including abnormal GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, and abnormalities in fatty acids. Ammonia is normally produced in the colon and is taken to the liver through the hepatic portal vein, where it is converted to urea and excreted in the urine. With liver dysfunction, ammonia and other toxic substances are shunted to the systemic circulation (the so-called portosystemic shunting). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, used to treat certain complications of portal hypertension (such as recurrent esophageal variceal hemorrhage), increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, as it enhances shunting of ammonia to the systemic circulation. Serum ammonia levels may be elevated, but hepatic encephalopathy may occur even at relatively low serum ammonia levels, due to the impaired cerebral ammonia uptake and metabolism seen in patients with cirrhosis. Clinical improvement in mental status is the best indicator of response to therapy, and serum ammonia concentrations are not reliable for this purpose. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy includes correction of precipitating factors (hypovolemia, gastrointestinal bleed, infection, and others), instituting a low-protein diet, and reduction of ammonia absorption from the colon by using the disaccharide 1356 lactulose, sometimes in combination with the antibiotics rifaximin or neomycin. The pathologic hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy is the Alzheimer type II astrocyte, which is seen in various areas of the cortex and subcortical regions, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, dentate of the cerebellum, and red nuclei.

Celiac disease, also known as gluten- sensitive enteropathy, results from an immune-mediated intolerance to gluten, a protein found in foods containing cereal grains. Chronic diarrhea with malabsorption is common, and small- bowel biopsy shows atrophy of intestinal villi. Celiac disease can have a variety of neurologic manifestations; in fact, neurologic manifestations may be the only clinical features in a minority of patients. These include a predominantly axonal peripheral neuropathy, inflammatory myopathy, cerebral calcifications, and seizures. Prominent cerebellar involvement is often seen because of loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The mainstay of treatment is a gluten-free diet, although some of the neurologic manifestations, such as ataxia resulting from cerebellar atrophy, may not be reversible. Patients with celiac disease can also have neurologic complications resulting from vitamin E deficiency (discussed in Chapter 17 ) due to chronic malabsorption. There is no increase in tendency for malignancy with celiac disease.

Patients with IBD are at an increased risk of both venous and arterial thrombosis, which may be due to activation of the coagulation cascade, impaired fibrinolysis, platelet activation, and systemic activation. Cerebral venous thrombosis and ischemic strokes may occur. Other neurologic complications include demyelinating and axonal neuropathies, myopathies, and cranial neuropathies, particularly cranial nerve VII palsy as is seen in Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome, which also includes tongue fissuring and angioedema.

Alteration in awareness from renal failure or uremic encephalopathy may manifest as reduced alertness, poor attention and concentration, perceptual errors, and hallucinations.

Patients with uremic encephalopathy, as with other metabolic encephalopathies, may exhibit multiple motor symptoms including asterixis, myoclonus (the so-called uremic twitching, attributed to alterations in cerebral phosphate metabolism), and gait ataxia. Seizures can occur in both acute and chronic renal failure. When treating seizures in patients with renal failure, attention must be given to the pharmacokinetic changes that occur in such patients. Uremic neuropathy is typically a distal, generalized symmetric sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Mononeuropathies can occur as a complication of arteriovenous shunt placement. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome is a spectrum of neurologic signs and symptoms occurring during or after dialysis. It is most common during initiation of urgent dialysis but may occur at any time.

Hyperglycemia, usually in the setting of a nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome, may also cause focal neurologic symptoms. Other metabolic abnormalities do not typically cause focal deficits. Hyponatremia typically causes more severe neurologic symptoms when it develops rapidly, but symptoms can also occur with chronic hyponatremia. A nonspecific encephalopathy is the most frequent manifestation. Seizures can occur with acute hyponatremia, usually with serum sodium levels of 115 mEq/L or less. Correction of serum sodium levels is the mainstay of treatment of hyponatremia-associated seizures, but care must be taken not to correct serum sodium levels too rapidly, given the risk of central pontine myelinolysis (discussed in Chapter 3 ). The rate of correction of hyponatremia should be no more than 12 mEq/L per day, or 0.5 mEq/L per hour. CNS manifestations of hypernatremia typically occur with serum sodium concentrations higher than 160 mEq/L and include encephalopathy, seizures, and in severe cases coma. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are associated with peripheral rather than CNS manifestations. Hypokalemia can lead to myalgia and proximal limb weakness (with sparing of bulbar muscles). Rhabdomyolysis can occur with severe hypokalemia. Tetany may be a manifestation of hypokalemia (or hypocalcemia). Hyperkalemia is associated with muscle weakness in the context of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis or Addison disease, but rarely otherwise. Neurologic manifestations of hypercalcemia include encephalopathy and in severe cases coma. Other manifestations include headache and rarely seizures. Hyperparathyroidism can lead to depression, encephalopathy, and myopathy. Seizures are a much more common complication of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia also leads to tetany, which is due to spontaneous repetitive nerve action potentials. Initial symptoms of hypocalcemia include tingling in the perioral area and the digits. In more severe later stages, tonic muscle spasms occur, beginning in the fingers and toes (carpopedal spasm) but in some cases involving more proximal musculature; when the tetany involves truncal 1360 musculature, opisthotonos is present. Hypomagnesemia can lead to encephalopathy, tremor, myoclonus, and in severe cases seizures. Hypermagnesemia is rare, usually occurring in the setting of renal failure.

Growth hormone deficiency is unlikely to lead to the mentioned presentation; vitamin D deficiency should be checked for in older adults, but symptoms (if any) include myalgias and other pains and/or sensory deficits, and are unlikely to present like in this patient. There is no suggestion of an autoimmune condition in this case, and a TSH would be more important to order than an antinuclear antibody. Antimicrosomal antibodies may be checked in the evaluation of a patient with thyroid dysfunction but would not be the first test to order. Antimicrosomal antibodies are also checked in patients with a relapsing–remitting encephalopathy or with other neurologic manifestations that raise concern for steroid- responsive encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT or Hashimoto encephalopathy).

      "explicacao": "Tremor is almost universally present in patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. It is typically a postural, high-frequency tremor that is thought to result from increased β-adrenergic activity. Other abnormal movements seen in patients with hyperthyroidism include parkinsonism, dyskinesia, chorea, and myoclonus. Pseudomyotonia, or a delay in muscle relaxation following elicitation of deep tendon reflex, is a feature of hypothyroidism. Congenital hypothyroidism is the most treatable cause of mental retardation. Untreated, it leads to cretinism, which is manifested by cognitive dysfunction, gait dysfunction, and hearing loss. The most common cause is dysgenesis of the thyroid, but severe maternal iodine deficiency also can lead to it. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can lead to myopathy. Serum creatine kinase level is typically elevated. Gait dysfunction in patients with thyroid disorders could be due to cerebellar ataxia, myopathy, neuropathy, or a combination of these. Thyroid eye disease in patients with Graves’ disease results from an immune-mediated increase in connective tissue of the orbit. Manifestations include proptosis, extraocular muscle enlargement with restricted movement, optic nerve compression, and ocular neuromyotonia. Restricted upward gaze is the most common extraocular abnormality seen in patients with thyroid eye disease, but impaired abduction, adduction, and downward gaze also occur. Eyelid retraction in patients with Graves’ disease may be due to overactivation of Muller muscle (a sympathetically innervated muscle) or eyelid fibrosis. Myxedema coma, due to severe untreated hypothyroidism, typically occurs in older adults and is often precipitated by intercurrent illnesses. Clinical features include hypothermia and encephalopathy. Seizures occur in some patients. Patients with hypothyroidism may develop diffuse peripheral neuropathy with both axonal and/or demyelinating features and entrapment neuropathy, most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome, 1362 resulting from deposition of mucopolysaccharides. Other neurologic manifestations of thyroid disease include both obstructive and central sleep apnea, headache, and hearing impairment with tinnitus. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

Diabetic polyneuropathy occurs in more than half of the patients with diabetes. It is pathophysiologically complex but is in part related to increased activity of the aldose reductase pathway, which leads to accumulation of intraneuronal sorbitol and fructose with subsequent impairment in intracellular signaling, impaired autooxidation of glucose, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, and impaired neuronal microvascular function. Early in diabetes, small nerve fibers are predominantly affected, leading to positive sensory symptoms such as tingling and pain. Large-fiber involvement may also lead to positive sensory symptoms, although later in the disease, sensory loss predominates. Diabetic polyneuropathy is most commonly a distal, symmetric, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Sensory loss is the most common clinical manifestation of diabetic polyneuropathy; motor weakness typically occurs only in advanced cases or from other complications of diabetes (discussed in Chapter 9 ). With involvement of nociceptive fibers, injuries may be painless, with the development of painless ulcers that often heal poorly, as in the case depicted in this question. Charcot joints, or relatively painless 1363 progressive deformities of the foot and ankle, also occur. Autonomic neuropathy is common in diabetics and can result in a variety of abnormalities including impotence, bladder dysfunction, abnormal pupillary reaction, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroparesis. Neuropathy can result from impaired glucose tolerance alone in patients not otherwise meeting laboratory criteria for diabetes. In fact, impaired glucose tolerance is often found in patients with otherwise idiopathic neuropathy, and treatment including diet and exercise may halt progression of the neuropathy. Diabetic polyneuropathy is irreversible, but slowing the progression is accomplished by adequate glycemic control. Painful neuropathy is treated with medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical agents such as capsaicin. Diabetic oculomotor palsy may present acutely and be associated with ipsilateral forehead pain. It results from ischemia to the third nerve; pupillomotor fibers are spared, given their more circumferential location, distinguishing it from other causes of acute oculomotor palsy such as cerebral aneurysms. Other cranial nerve palsies, particularly VI and VII, can occur in diabetes. CNS complications of diabetes may result from diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, both of which can lead to encephalopathy and in severe cases stupor and coma. Cerebrovascular disease due to atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis due to frequently comorbid hypertension can lead to various CNS manifestations resulting from ischemic stroke. Acute and sometimes permanent chorea can occur in patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Botelhoa MC, Conde MG, RebeloBraz NM.

It is caused by a mutation in an ATPase or a chloride channel. Autosomal dominant and recessive forms exist, each differing in their age at presentation and clinical manifestations. Some of the younger-onset forms are severe. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, but symptoms may include bone pain, joint deformities, secondary osteoarthritis, and fractures. Many adults with osteopetrosis are asymptomatic, but cranial neuropathies may occur because of skull thickening with subsequent narrowing of cranial nerve (CN) foramina in the base of the skull. The most commonly involved CNs are CN II (in some cases leading to optic atrophy with blindness), VII, and VIII, leading to irreversible hearing loss, as in this patient. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level is a clue to this diagnosis. The olfactory nerve is also commonly involved. A bone disorder with similar neurologic complications to osteopetrosis is Paget disease. Paget disease results from excessive bone turnover and abnormal compensatory bone formation. It is often asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally, but it may also result in cranial neuropathies (most commonly CN VIII, but also CN II), spinal stenosis with resulting myelopathy, radiculopathy, or a combination of these. Serum alkaline phosphatase level is also elevated in Paget disease. Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant bone dysplasia characterized by short stature. Cognition often develops normally, but in some, developmental delay may be present. Other neurologic complications include cervical myelopathy due to craniocervical junction abnormalities, radiculopathy, and hydrocephalus. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic polyarticular inflammatory disorder that involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Uveitis and 1366 aortic insufficiency may occur. Neurologic complications include vertebral fracture with secondary spinal cord injury and spinal stenosis, leading to radiculopathy and/or myelopathy. Cauda equina syndrome may occur. Relapsing polychondritis results from recurrent episodes of inflammation and destruction of cartilage. Episodes commonly involve not only the ears but also the upper airway. Neurologic manifestations include vertigo and hearing loss due to involvement of the vestibulocochlear system. Ocular motor palsies and optic neuritis may rarely occur. Other neurologic manifestations of relapsing polychondritis include cerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, and aseptic meningitis. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE include cognitive dysfunction, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. Headaches and seizures are among the most common neurologic manifestations; others include aseptic meningitis (as is likely the case in this patient), chorea, and myelopathy. There is an increased risk of ischemic strokes due to a variety of mechanisms including cardioembolism, antiphospholipid antibody–associated thrombosis, 1367 premature intracranial atherosclerosis, and rarely secondary cerebral vasculitis. Intracerebral hemorrhage may also occur. Peripheral nervous system manifestations include cranial neuropathies, peripheral mononeuropathy or mononeuritis multiplex, demyelinating or axonal polyneuropathy, and plexopathy. Systemic sclerosis is a multiorgan disorder that leads to fibrosis. Scleroderma is the term used to describe the skin thickening that is seen in this disorder. Subcutaneous calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia (CREST) syndrome is seen in some patients with systemic sclerosis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of clinical features and antibodies against centromeres and topoisomerases.

Rectal biopsy is used to diagnose amyloidosis and is not helpful in the diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome. Sjögren syndrome is an inflammatory multiorgan disorder primarily affecting exocrine glands (such as the salivary and lacrimal glands), leading to xerostomia and xerophthalmia (which when severe can lead to keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Sjögren 1368 syndrome often co-occurs with other autoimmune disorders. Constitutional symptoms are often present. Peripheral nervous system involvement in Sjögren syndrome manifests most commonly as a distal predominantly sensory or mixed sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. A sensory neuronopathy, or dorsal root ganglionopathy, as depicted in this case, may occur, and results from involvement of the dorsal root ganglia. With sensory neuronopathy, the sensory loss may not follow a length-dependent pattern but rather can affect the face or trunk before distal segments of the limbs (discussed further in Chapter 9). Sensory ataxia is often prominent in such cases. Other manifestations of Sjögren syndrome include isolated small-fiber neuropathy (without large-fiber involvement), autonomic neuropathy, and cranial neuropathy. CNS manifestations of Sjögren syndrome are uncommon but include cognitive dysfunction, focal brain lesions most often affecting subcortical white matter, aseptic meningitis, optic neuritis, and myelopathy. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of symptoms of xerostomia and xerophthalmia, objective documentation of xerophthalmia with Schirmer test, serologic testing for the autoantibodies anti-Ro (SSA) or anti-La (SSB), and/or minor salivary gland biopsy. Treatment is a combination of symptomatic therapies and immunosuppressants in some cases. This patient’s examination and nerve conduction findings are not consistent with an isolated small-fiber neuropathy, in which NCS are normal. Normal motor NCS would not be seen in a sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Churg–Strauss syndrome is discussed in questions 20 and 21. Small-fiber neuropathy due to systemic lupus erythematosus would not be associated with abnormal NCS, and other systemic features would be present.

Recurrent oral and genital ulcers are seen in Behçet disease (see discussion to question 23). PAN, Wegener granulomatosis, Kawasaki disease, and Churg– Strauss syndrome are systemic necrotizing vasculitides involving medium and small vessels. These diseases typically involve multiple organs and often manifest with prominent constitutional symptoms. Neurologic manifestations of the systemic vasculitides of medium and small vessels include seizures, mononeuritis multiplex, cranial neuropathies (with the most frequently involved being cranial nerve VIII), and peripheral polyneuropathies. The neuropathy seen in these vasculitides is a necrotizing vasculitic ischemic neuropathy due to involvement of vasa vasorum. Figure 16.1 shows a nerve biopsy specimen demonstrating perivascular neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate with necrosis. Arteritis of cerebral blood vessels may also lead to ischemic stroke. Although overlap occurs in these different disorders, certain features help distinguish them. Diagnostic criteria for Churg– Strauss syndrome include asthma, eosinophilia, and sinus and pulmonary involvement. Features of Wegener granulomatosis include glomerulonephritis, paranasal sinusitis, and pulmonary involvement. The presence of granulomas on biopsy and the presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) antibody and antibodies to proteinase-3 allow for the diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis. Polyarteritis nodosa leads to a vasculopathy in multiple organ systems. It presents with prominent constitutional symptoms, renal, cardiac, and gastrointestinal involvement, and may be associated with chronic hepatitis B infection. Skin manifestations include livedo reticularis, skin ulcerations, and subcutaneous nodules. Abdominal angiogram characteristically demonstrates small aneurysms in mesenteric arteries. Kawasaki disease is a disorder of childhood and is characterized by acute onset of fever, conjunctivitis, mucositis, polymorphous rash, lymphadenopathy, and other findings, including increased risk coronary artery aneurysms; neurologic involvement includes 1371 the occurrence of aseptic meningitis.

Takayasu arteritis manifests with constitutional symptoms and symptoms related to organ ischemia such as peripheral claudication. Treatment is with immunosuppression and in some cases surgical or endovascular treatment of vessel stenosis or occlusion. Polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis, and temporal arteritis affect medium or small vessels as opposed to large ones. Temporal arteritis, or giant-cell arteritis most commonly leads to headaches, but ischemic strokes or transient ischemic attacks can also occur in a minority due to involvement of the carotid and vertebral arteries.

The skin pathergy test may be helpful. MRI brain may show focal changes, ventriculomegaly, or stroke, but is not specific. Temporal artery biopsy is helpful in giant-cell arteritis but not in Behçet disease. CSF may show elevated pressure, protein, or pleocytosis, but is not diagnostic for Behçet disease. Herpes viral infection is on the differential of labial or genital ulcers but is not involved in the pathophysiology of Behçet disease which this patient’s history suggests. Behçet disease is a systemic inflammatory disorder that typically affects multiple organs, including the eyes, skin, gastrointestinal tract, joints, and vascular system. Uveitis and orogenital ulcers are characteristic manifestations. Diagnostic criteria include recurrent oral ulceration, plus two of the following: recurrent genital ulceration, eye lesions including uveitis, skin lesions (such as papulopustular lesions), or a positive pathergy skin test. Patients may also have arthritis, subcutaneous thrombophlebitis, deep venous thrombosis, and gastrointestinal lesions. Behçet disease is most common in younger women of Mediterranean or East-Asian descent. The most common CNS manifestation is headache. CNS involvement may also include focal inflammatory brain lesions most commonly affecting the basal ganglia and/or brain stem. Progressive personality change, psychiatric disorders, and dementia may develop. Increased intracranial pressure associated with venous sinus thrombosis is another potential manifestation of CNS involvement. Unlike other systemic vasculitides, peripheral nervous system involvement with Behçet disease is rare, although peripheral neuropathy or myopathy may occur. Al-Araji A, Kidd DP.

      "explicacao": "While several systemic diseases are associated with increased risk of thrombosis, of those listed, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) is the most likely to cause thrombosis that may involve the CNS. APLS and most of the so-called hereditary thrombophilias, including G20210 A prothrombin polymorphism, mutation in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene (leading to hyperhomocysteinemia), factor V Leiden, antithrombin III deficiency, and protein C and S deficiency, lead to venous thrombosis. Venous sinus thrombosis is the most common neurologic manifestation of these disorders, and could lead to venous infarction. Ischemic infarcts may also occur secondary to paradoxical emboli to the cerebral vasculature from the venous system through an intracardiac right-to-left shunt. Arterial thrombosis may also occur. Other causes of both venous and arterial thrombosis include malignancy, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, systemic vasculitides (discussed in questions 20 and 21) and myeloproliferative diseases (such as essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia rubra vera, and others). APLS is a disorder of coagulation resulting from the presence of circulating antibodies against phospholipid-bound proteins such as anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant antibodies. In addition to venous and less commonly arterial thrombosis, other neurologic manifestations seen in APLS include chorea, headaches, and seizures. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

Myelopathy can occur but is relatively uncommon. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous, immune-mediated disorder that may involve multiple organ systems including (but not limited to) the lungs (most commonly), skin, heart, and central and peripheral nervous system. In the United States, it is more common in African- American women. Neurologic signs or symptoms as the primary presentation are rare; less than 10% of sarcoidosis cases present with extrapulmonary involvement leading to diagnosis. The most common presentation of neurosarcoidosis is cranial neuropathy, with cranial nerve VII being the most frequently affected. Multiple cranial neuropathies may occur in some patients. Other neurologic manifestations include aseptic meningitis (as in the case presented in this question), hydrocephalus, parenchymal disease/mass lesion, myelopathy, small- and large-fiber peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy. Hypothalamic or pituitary involvement may lead to endocrinopathy. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is established on the basis of the history, examination, and demonstration of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is neither sensitive nor specific, but increased serum ACE levels are a marker of disease activity. In patients with known systemic sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis is diagnosed in the setting of neurologic signs or symptoms and/or findings on CSF or MRI of the brain or spine (although alternative causes, such as in CNS infections in sarcoidosis patients being treated with immunosuppressive therapy must also be considered and excluded). Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, often with 1375 predominance at the base of the brain, is the classic finding, although focal parenchymal enhancing brain lesions can also occur (as shown in Fig. 16.2 in the splenium of the corpus callosum) as can intramedullary or extramedullary enhancing spine lesions. Treatment is with immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids and, in some cases, steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate. TNF-alpha blocking agents have also been used as well as other cytotoxic agents. Natalizumab is used in multiple sclerosis treatment. There is no surgical treatment for sarcoidosis.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history is concerning for pheochromocytoma, which may present with episodes of headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations in the setting of elevated blood pressure. Pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors derived from amine precursor uptake decarboxylation (APUD) cells. Included in the group of APUD cell tumors are carcinoid tumors, paraganglioneuromas, neuroblastoma, and others. Pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells and secrete catecholamines. The majority arise from the adrenal medulla, although in a minority, they arise from the sympathetic ganglia, in which case they are termed catecholamine-secreting paragangliomas. Pheochromocytomas are most commonly sporadic, although in a minority, they occur as part of other syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, von Hippel–Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge–Weber syndrome (discussed in Chapter 14 ). They are most commonly benign but are malignant in a minority of patients. Diagnosis of pheochromocytomas may be aided by measurement of catecholamines, metanephrines, and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in a 24-hour urine collection; 1376 measurement of plasma-free metanephrines is the most sensitive test. The differential diagnosis for patients with the presentation depicted in the case is broad, but elevated blood pressure in the setting of these symptoms warrants exclusion of pheochromocytoma before a diagnosis of anxiety or hot flashes due to menopause is made. Carcinoid syndrome can present with episodic flushing and headache associated with other symptoms; diagnosis is made by measurement of urinary 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

      "explicacao": "The anterior pituitary, or adenohypophysis, is derived embryologically from Rathke pouch, which evaginates from the oropharyngeal membrane during fetal development. The hypothalamus modulates pituitary function, and pituitary hormones in turn modulate hypothalamic function. The pituitary derives its blood supply from the superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries, which arise from the ICA. The superior hypophyseal artery forms a capillary plexus in the hypothalamic median eminence. Blood carrying regulatory hypothalamic hormones flows from there in the hypophyseal portal vein, through the infundibulum (or pituitary stalk) to the anterior pituitary. Secretion of prolactin by the anterior pituitary is modulated by dopamine. Growth hormone–releasing hormone secreted by the hypothalamus regulates growth hormone release by the anterior pituitary. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone secreted by the hypothalamus modulates thyroid-stimulating hormone release, and gonadotropic-releasing hormone secreted by the hypothalamus modulates release of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary. ACTH release by the anterior pituitary is modulated by corticotrophin-releasing hormone from 1377 the hypothalamus. The posterior pituitary, or neurohypophysis, originates from an extension of the neuroectoderm of the diencephalon. Magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus synthesize antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. These are then moved via axonal transport, where they are stored and released by the posterior pituitary. The classic visual field deficit occurring with pituitary masses is a bitemporal hemianopia due to pressure on the optic chiasm. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA.

      "explicacao": "Given this patient’s recent history of a neurosurgical procedure in the pituitary region, she most likely has central diabetes insipidus (DI), due to deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is synthesized by the magnocellular cells in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary. Synthesis and secretion of ADH is modulated by serum osmolality; increases in serum osmolality normally lead to release of ADH, which stimulates renal tubular resorption of water. Central DI manifests clinically with thirst, polydipsia, and polyuria. It is not uncommon following neurosurgery and may be transient. Other causes of central DI include trauma, hypoxic– ischemic insult, compressive lesions in the sellar or suprasellar region, and infiltration of the hypothalamus due to granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis (discussed in questions 25 and 26). In some cases, the disorder is idiopathic. In patients with DI, urine osmolality is low: the urine is dilute due to inadequate resorption of water and hence excessive excretion of water in the urine. Central DI is distinguished from nephrogenic DI, which results from inadequate renal response to ADH. In patients with central 1378 DI, administration of desmopressin (an ADH analog) will lead to urinary concentration and therefore an increase in urine osmolality and a reduction in serum sodium concentration. In nephrogenic DI, urine osmolality does not increase in response to desmopressin. One of the causes of nephrogenic DI is lithium carbonate. The treatment of central DI includes allowing free access to water (allowing patients to maintain adequate intake of water) and administration of desmopressin. Water restriction will worsen hypernatremia, as will hypertonic saline. Aminoff MJ, Josephson SA. Aminoff’s Neurology and General Medicine. 5th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier; 2014.

Unlike patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) who are typically euvolemic, in cerebral salt- wasting syndrome, the patient is hypovolemic, and the treatment is with salt supplementation and intravenous isotonic (or sometimes hypertonic) fluid administration. The pathophysiology of cerebral salt-wasting syndrome is not clear, but it may in part relate to increased levels of atrial natriuretic peptide released from the cardiac atria. SIADH may occur following head trauma, neurosurgery, SAH and with paraneoplastic ectopic antidiuretic hormone production. Several medications may also cause SIADH.

      "explicacao": "Given this patient’s presentation, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis should be excluded, and MRV would be the most appropriate test to order. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are hypercoagulable states, predisposing to venous sinus thrombosis. In pregnancy, levels of several of the procoagulant factors are elevated, including fibrinogen and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X. These elevations, associated with a reduction in protein S levels, increase susceptibility to venous thrombosis. Given this patient’s family history, a hereditary thrombophilia or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may also have contributed to her risk of thrombosis (see discussion to question 24). Venous sinus thrombosis can occur during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. In addition to headache and other signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, seizures can occur. A CT scan with contrast would be of little utility in this case; it may show a triangular area of central hypodensity surrounded by a rim of hyperintensity in the superior sagittal sinus (the so-called empty delta sign), but absence of this sign would not exclude the diagnosis. Cerebral angiogram is not indicated, although if this patient’s condition deteriorates significantly, venogram with venous thrombectomy may be necessary. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography could be used to exclude vasospasm as occurs in postpartum angiopathy (discussed in question 31), but the presence of papilledema in this case makes the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis more likely. Similarly, while subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, and other indications for LP in the postpartum period can occur, the presence of 1381 papilledema makes an MRV of higher priority.

      "explicacao": "This patient’s history, presentation, laboratory findings, and elevated blood pressure are consistent with eclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by gestational hypertension and proteinuria, often associated with edema in the face and hands. Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures in association with hypertension and edema during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. The pathophysiology may relate to impaired trophoblast invasion of the endometrium and immune-mediated and endocrinologic mechanisms. Associated symptoms may include headache, visual disturbance, and epigastric abdominal pain. Postpartum eclampsia is more commonly associated with complications including disseminated intravascular coagulation and respiratory distress. In more severe cases, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and/or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome may occur. Management of eclampsia includes delivery (which should be the priority if the pregnancy is at or close to term) and intravenous medications such as hydralazine or labetalol for blood pressure reduction (although excessive reductions should be avoided to maintain fetal blood flow). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be avoided given potential effects on the fetal kidney. Intravenous magnesium sulfate should be administered for the control and prevention of seizures, and should be used in this patient. Close monitoring is necessary as magnesium toxicity may lead to maternal respiratory distress. The use of AEDs is 1382 controversial, but medications that depress the fetus, such as pentobarbital or phenobarbital, should be avoided; oral diazepam is likely to be of little utility in seizure control and may depress the fetus. Gestational hypertension is the presence of hypertension without associated proteinuria occurring beyond 20 weeks of gestation. Venous sinus thrombosis can lead to seizures and should be on the differential diagnosis of a patient in the peripartum period presenting with seizures, but the presence of proteinuria and hypertension point to eclampsia. Similarly, the history and laboratory features make meningitis less likely. Frontera JA, Ahmed W. Neurocritical care complications of pregnancy and puerperum. J Crit Care. 2014;29(6): 1069–1081.

Seizure frequency in pregnant patients with epilepsy is variable and unpredictable; approximately one-third have increased seizure frequency in pregnancy, whereas the rest have a reduction or no change in seizure frequency. The majority of women with a history of migraine have a reduction in migraines during their pregnancy, although some women may have a worsening, and migraines can occur for the first time in pregnant women without pre-existing migraines. In the latter patients, exclusion of other causes of headache such as venous sinus thrombosis (discussed in question 32) is important. The effects of pregnancy on myasthenia gravis are variable. Approximately one- third of women have significant worsening; improvement in the second and third trimesters occurs in others, and thought to be related to the relative immunosuppression that occurs during this period.

      "explicacao": "Lysergic acid diethylamide does not produce a withdrawal syndrome. Lysergic acid is one of the ergot fungus’ diverse alkaloid components, and it is a potent mood-changing and hallucinogenic drug (it is discussed further in question 18). Cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol, and opiates all have well-defined withdrawal syndromes and are discussed in further questions. A marijuana (Cannabis) withdrawal syndrome has been debated. The World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision does recognize a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. This withdrawal syndrome was not previously recognized in the DSM-IV but included in the DSM-V. Symptoms of cannabis withdrawal syndrome may include nervousness or anxiety, decreased appetite or weight loss, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, anger or aggression, depressed mood, and physical symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, sweating, tremors and/or abdominal pain. Marijuana is typically smoked, although it is also ingested orally when added to other foods or drinks. One of the most studied cannabinoids in cannabis is δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and this accounts for its psychoactive effects. This is in 1400 contrast to cannabidiol (CBD), which has no psychoactive effects and accounts for many of the medicinal properties of cannabis. Common side effects include increased appetite (THC is sometimes used for anorexia and as an antiemetic in cancer and AIDS patients), tachycardia, dry mouth, conjunctival injection, excessive laughter, memory impairment, poor attention span, sedation, paranoia, anxiety, delusions, impaired coordination, and poor insight and judgment. Chronic use may cause flat affect, apathy, lack of motivation, and neurocognitive and memory impairments, especially when used in adolescence. THC is active in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum. THC’s effects on the hippocampus may help explain the memory problems that can develop with the use of cannabis, and those on the cerebellum may help explain the loss of coordination and imbalance sometimes seen.

      "explicacao": "Opiate use and intoxication classically are associated with miosis, or pinpoint pupils, not mydriasis. Of note, this must be differentiated from pontine lesions, which can also cause pinpoint 1401 pupils. All of the other options can be seen with opiate intoxication, including decreased body temperature and coma. In addition to these findings, common side effects include euphoria, drowsiness, analgesia, and constipation (hence the use of opiates and opiate derivatives as antidiarrheals). Opiate toxicity/overdose creates a “silent gut”, which can help in the diagnosis. Because of its cough suppressant effects, codeine is sometimes used in cough medicines. Treatment of suspected opiate overdose includes the opioid antagonist naloxone at 0.4 to 2 mg intravenously every 2 to 3 minutes. The diagnosis should be questioned if there is no response even after administration of 10 mg. Naltrexone is also an opioid antagonist, but used in longer-term treatment of opioid and alcohol dependence as opposed to naloxone, which is used in emergency settings. Flumazenil is given for benzodiazepine overdose. The dose of flumazenil is 0.2 to 0.5 mg intravenously every minute to a maximum total dose of 5 mg. Thiamine and glucose are not used for opiate overdose. Opiate withdrawal occurs within hours to several days of cessation. Withdrawal symptoms are often quite severe and cause significant functional impairment. They include dysphoria, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, diaphoresis, diarrhea, mydriasis, fever, and insomnia. Difficulty often exists in differentiating opiate from sedative (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines) withdrawal. Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) can help in this differentiation because increased DTRs are typical in alcohol or sedative withdrawal but not opioid withdrawal. Therefore, if you see increased DTRs and give more opioids for suspected opioid withdrawal in the setting of actual sedative withdrawal, benzodiazepine or alcohol withdrawal seizures will be a likely complication. Opiates are one of multiple euphoria-producing drugs. All euphoria-producing drugs cause release of dopamine from the midbrain to the forebrain in the reward circuit (ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens). The caudate nucleus is included in this pathway. These areas contain especially high concentrations of dopaminergic synapses. The opiates also interact with other structures modulated by endorphins, including the amygdala, locus 1402 coeruleus, arcuate nucleus, thalamus, and the periaqueductal gray matter, which influence dopaminergic pathways indirectly. There are natural and synthetic forms of opiates. Opioid receptors are a group of G-protein coupled receptors, with opioids acting as ligands. The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, and endomorphins. There are four major subtypes of opioid receptors. The first is δ, including subtypes δ 1 and δ 2 . They are involved with analgesia, antidepressant effects, and physical dependence. The second is κ and includes κ 1 , κ 2 , and κ 3 . These are involved in spinal analgesia, sedation, miosis, and inhibition of antidiuretic hormone release. The third is μ and includes μ 1 , μ 2 , and μ 3 . The subtype μ 1 is involved in supraspinal analgesia and physical dependence; μ 2 is involved in respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, reduced gastrointestinal motility, and physical dependence. The actions of μ 3 are not clear. The fourth is ORL 1 /orphanin (or nociceptin receptor), which is involved in anxiety, depression, appetite, and development of tolerance to μ agonists.

Stroke and myocardial infarction can occur. Similar to all of the euphoria-producing drugs, there are effects of amphetamines and cocaine on the reward circuit (the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens). Withdrawal symptoms are also similar with amphetamines and cocaine and include dysphoria, vivid/unpleasant dreams, increased appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, agitation, or psychomotor retardation.

      "explicacao": "This patient has suspected alcohol intoxication. Symptoms include confusion, somnolence, ataxia, dysarthria, hypotension (later hypertension), impaired judgment, and tachycardia. When this is suspected, intravenous thiamine has been classically recommended, and should be given prior to intravenous glucose administration to avoid precipitation of Wernicke’s encephalopathy due to acute thiamine deficiency. However, more recent literature raises questions regarding the validity of this practice. Thiamine is converted to thiamine pyrophosphate, which acts as a cofactor in several metabolic pathways necessary in energy metabolism. When there is a high metabolic demand (such as after a glucose load) in the setting of thiamine deficiency, cellular damage occurs and Wernicke’s encephalopathy may result. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is characterized by confusion/mental status changes, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus. The chronic phase of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, known as Korsakoff syndrome, is associated with anterograde amnesia, although there are components also of retrograde amnesia. MRI findings in Wernicke’s encephalopathy may include petechial hemorrhages classically in the mammillary bodies, but also in hypothalamus, medial thalami, and periaqueductal gray matter, sometimes even extending into the medulla, with atrophy seen in chronic stages. Acute thiamine deficiency does not typically lead to changes in the caudate nucleus. Alcohol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs affect not only the basic structures of the reward circuit but also several other structures that use GABA as a neurotransmitter. GABA is one of the most widespread neurotransmitters in several parts of the brain, including the cortex, the cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, and superior and inferior colliculi. Alcohol exerts its effects by stimulation of the GABA A receptor, similar to the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. This is why benzodiazepines are used to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol also inhibits glutamate- induced excitation, which leads to additive CNS-depressant effects. Chronic alcohol use has detrimental multisystemic effects. 1405 Alcohol withdrawal can be quite severe and can even lead to death if not treated appropriately. Minor withdrawal symptoms begin within 6 to 36 hours from the last drink and include headache, tremors, diaphoresis, palpitations, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, anorexia, agitation, and anxiety. Mentation is preserved during this period. Seizures can occur generally 6 to 48 hours after the last drink. Alcoholic hallucinosis begins at 12 to 48 hours and includes hallucinations (mostly visual but can also be auditory and tactile), intact orientation, and stable vital signs. Delirium tremens occurs at 48 to 96 hours if adequate prophylaxis is not initiated and is characterized by delirium, hallucinations, disorientation, agitation, encephalopathy, hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, low-grade fever, and diaphoresis. In severe cases, delirium tremens can be fatal. β-Blockers and calcium channel blockers can be used for hypertension and tachycardia, although these will merely mask symptoms. Use of phenytoin or other anticonvulsants is appropriate in those with seizures and pre-existing epilepsy. This history is not present in the patient described, and antiepileptic agents are not indicated in this case. Benzodiazepines such as lorazepam should be given as scheduled doses to prevent withdrawal symptoms (including seizures), and these are the most important medications to add in this setting. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms often occur in unrecognized alcoholic patients who are admitted for surgeries or other reasons. Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic used to treat insomnia, and not indicated in this setting. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al. Bradley’s Neurology in Clinical Practice. 6th ed.

Adenosine normally inhibits release of excitatory neurotransmitters, leading to reduced neuronal firing rate and decreased cortical excitability. Caffeine competitively antagonizes the adenosine A1 and A2A G-protein–coupled receptor subtypes. The resulting decreased activity of adenosine by caffeine leads to increased release of excitatory neurotransmitters, and thus the stimulating effects noted with caffeine. Shapiro RE.

      "explicacao": "This patient exhibits symptoms of intoxication with phenylcyclohexyl piperidine, more commonly known as phencyclidine (PCP). This was a drug developed initially as a dissociative anesthetic, primarily used in animals. It is structurally similar to ketamine, which is used for medical anesthesia. Hypertension, tachycardia, nystagmus (vertical, lateral, horizontal, 1407 or rotatory), decreased pain sensation (often causing superhuman appearance of strength), rage, muscle rigidity, seizures, bizarre behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, impaired judgment, confusion, dysarthria, ataxia, and myoclonic jerks are all characteristic findings in PCP intoxication. Its use can also lead to hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and multiorgan failure. PCP is used by oral, intravenous, or intranasal routes. It acts as a noncompetitive antagonist at the glutamate NMDA receptor. PCP has been shown to affect biogenic amine (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) release and reuptake. These actions probably account for the sympathomimetic effects of PCP. PCP is structurally similar to ketamine, but it differs from ketamine in that it is longer acting, is more likely to cause seizures, and tends to cause more emergent confusion and delirium. Ketamine also acts as a noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor. It also has interactions with muscarinic, nicotinic, and cholinergic receptors and inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. The other choices listed are of the psychedelic or hallucinogenic category. Although some symptoms can overlap with PCP intoxication, the symptoms described in this case are characteristic of PCP. Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) comes from specific types of mushrooms, and mescaline comes from the peyote cactus. Lysergic acid is one of the ergot fungus’ diverse alkaloid components, and lysergic acid diethylamide was popularized as a potent mood-changing and hallucinogenic drug. Use of the different hallucinogens leads to many similar symptoms including sensory distortions (such as synesthesias; “feeling” colors, “seeing” sound), illusions, hallucinations, euphoria, anxiety, tachycardia, palpitations, pupillary dilation (as opposed to opiates, which cause miosis), and diaphoresis. The hallucinogens primarily work at various serotonergic receptors. Different receptor subtypes are modulated by these various drugs, some of which may do so through agonism, whereas others through antagonism. The serotonin 5HT 2 receptor is particularly thought to be involved in the action of these drugs. Some of these drugs may have some effects at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors. In addition, 3, 4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ecstasy, blocks 1408 reuptake of serotonin, and prolonged use of MDMA results in destruction of serotonergic neurons in the brain.

      "explicacao": "This patient has copper deficiency related to excess zinc intake, and treatment should include copper supplementation and decreasing zinc intake. This can be related to excess dietary intake (as in this case), overuse of denture cream, parenteral feeding deficiency, and gastrointestinal surgery. This syndrome occurs because zinc increases enterocyte metallothionein synthesis. These excess enterocyte metallothioneins easily bind copper. The resultant excessively bound copper within the enterocytes is then excreted when the enterocytes are sloughed off, resulting in impaired absorption. Copper deficiency myelopathy syndrome resembles the subacute combined degeneration seen with vitamin B 12 deficiency. Copper deficiency causes a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with axonal loss features on electrodiagnostic studies combined with myelopathy in the form of spastic paraparesis and posterior column dysfunction. Pancytopenia is also frequently associated. (Copper deficiency is discussed also in Chapter 11 .) The history of excess zinc intake makes copper deficiency more likely than vitamin B 12 deficiency in this particular patient, however, B 12 level 1409 should be evaluated in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of myelopathy and neuropathy. Vitamin E deficiency can mimic symptoms of spinocerebellar ataxia, which is not present in this patient. Goodman BP, Bosch EP, Ross MA, et al.

These vitamins need to be supplemented, especially vitamin E as in this case. Symptoms resemble a spinocerebellar ataxia syndrome such as Friedrich ataxia and may include ataxia, dysarthria, areflexia, extensor plantar responses, and large-fiber sensory loss. Presentation can occur at any age in the setting of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption disorders. Vitamin E deficiency is more likely to occur in childhood when a genetic etiology is present, such as α- tocopherol-transfer protein mutation or abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen–Kornzweig syndrome). Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by a mutation of a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein resulting in absence of apolipoprotein B–containing proteins. This affects absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and laboratory findings show low vitamin E levels. Acanthocytosis may also be seen on peripheral smear.

      "explicacao": "Extensor plantar responses would not be seen in thiamine (vitamin B 1 ) deficiency. This deficiency would be more likely to cause peripheral neuropathy (with mute or flexor plantar responses). Thiamine deficiency in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome is discussed in questions 10–15. Thiamine deficiency causes an axonal, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with weakness and distal sensory loss. This is termed “dry beriberi.” When it is associated with cardiac involvement in the form of cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia and tachycardia, and peripheral edema, it is called “wet beriberi.” Thiamine deficiency has also been reported to cause Leigh syndrome (Leigh subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy). Laboratory findings of thiamine deficiency may include decreased serum thiamine, erythrocyte transketolase activity and urinary thiamine. Erythrocyte thiamine transketolase should be measured before and after administration of thiamine pyrophosphate, and low levels with increase of more than 25% after administration supports the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. In the setting of a neuropathy, electrodiagnostic findings may be consistent with an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "resposta_correta": "d",
      "explicacao": "The neurologic deficits in vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) deficiency are 1411 ultimately related to a defect in methionine production. Vitamin B 12 is a cofactor for methionine synthase, which is involved in conversion of homocysteine to methionine and production of succinyl-CoA from methylmalonyl-CoA. Methionine is subsequently a precursor for S-adenosyl- L -methionine, which helps with methylation of myelin basic protein. Without this process, abnormal myelin structure results in neurologic deficit. The syndrome resulting from vitamin B 12 deficiency is called subacute combined degeneration because of sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy combined with myelopathy, spastic paraparesis and posterior column dysfunction. Complete blood cell count may reveal a macrocytic anemia. Occasionally, vitamin B 12 levels may be in the low normal or even normal range despite true deficiency. If clinical suspicion is present for deficiency, the levels of metabolic intermediaries homocysteine and methylmalonic acid should be checked, both of which would be elevated in vitamin B 12 deficiency. Animal products (meat and dairy) provide the primary dietary source of vitamin B 12 for humans. This puts older adults, alcoholics, patients with malnutrition, and strict vegans at high risk for development of this deficiency. Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J, et al.

      "explicacao": "This patient exhibits symptoms consistent with arsenic poisoning. 1412 Arsenic is a naturally occurring element most commonly incorporated into organic or inorganic compounds, both of which are very toxic. It can also occur in gas form. With acute exposure, symptoms may develop within minutes to hours and usually begin with gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. A garlic odor on the breath is characteristic. These symptoms can be followed by hypotension, dehydration, and cardiac and respiratory instability. Delirium, encephalopathy, coma, and seizures may occur. Other acute manifestations include proteinuria, hematuria, and acute tubular necrosis. If patients survive, within 1 to 3 weeks, they can develop hepatitis, pancytopenia, and a symmetric sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, which typically begins with distal paresthesias, followed rapidly by an ascending sensory loss and weakness, which mimics Guillain–Barré syndrome. The neuropathy can progress to intense burning pain, especially in the soles. In addition, dermatologic lesions can occur and may include alopecia, oral mucosal ulcerations, diffuse pruritic macular rash, and scaly rash on the palms and soles. A dry hacking cough and Mees lines (horizontal 1 to 2 mm white lines on the nails) may also occur. In chronic poisoning, the peripheral neuropathy and dermatologic symptoms are usually more prominent than the gastrointestinal symptoms. Cancers of the liver, bladder, kidney, skin, lung, nasal mucosa, and prostate have been reported with chronic exposure. After a suspected acute ingestion of arsenic, abdominal radiographs may reveal gastrointestinal radiopaque material. Urine arsenic levels are preferable to blood arsenic levels, but both can be used. Fish or shellfish intake within the previous 48 to 72 hours can cause falsely elevated levels of arsenic. For chronic exposure, hair and nail samples can be analyzed for the presence of arsenic, and 24-hour urine arsenic or spot urine arsenic and creatinine levels can be checked. Additional evaluations should include renal and liver function tests, complete blood cell count, urinalysis, and electrodiagnostic testing if there are symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. A distal sensorimotor axonopathy is the typical finding. Acute treatment includes fluid and electrolyte replacement, cardiac monitoring, activated charcoal, and chelation therapy. 1413 Chelation agents typically used include dimercaprol (British Anti- Lewisite) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer). Although symptoms can mimic Guillain–Barré syndrome, the constellation of clinical symptoms and signs described and adequate evaluation should have ruled this out. Cyanide and mercury poisoning are discussed in questions 30 and 31, respectively. Thallium causes acute gastrointestinal symptoms, confusion, painful (mostly sensory) neuropathy with autonomic features, and alopecia, which classically occurs about 2 to 4 weeks after ingestion. The clinical features including the reported garlic smell in her breath, as well as the timing, suggest the diagnosis of arsenic intoxication. Danan M, Dally S, Conso F.

In industrialized countries, the most common cause of cyanide poisoning are domestic fires due to combustion of products containing carbon and nitrogen, such as wool, silk, polyurethane (insulation/upholstery), and plastics. There are many industrial causes, such as electroplating in this case. There are also dietary causes, especially from ingestion of plant products from the family Rosaceae, including the seeds and pits of the plum, peach, pear, bitter almond, cherry laurel, apricot, and apple. Cyanide is a rapidly lethal mitochondrial toxin that can cause 1414 death within minutes to hours of exposure. Cyanide competes with oxygen and binds to the ferric ion (Fe3+) of cytochrome oxidase a 3 , which inhibits this final enzyme in the mitochondrial cytochrome complex, resulting in cessation of oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, cells cannot use oxygen in their electron transport chain and must switch to anaerobic metabolism. Because of the decreased utilization of oxygen by tissues, venous oxyhemoglobin concentration will be high, making venous blood appear bright red and thus, the bright red coloration of skin, similar to the effects of carbon monoxide. Cyanide also causes toxic oxygen free radicals, release of glutamate, and inhibition of glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme that helps form the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA). CNS symptoms include headache, anxiety, abnormal taste, encephalopathy, vertigo, and seizures. Cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain, initial tachycardia, and hypertension, then bradycardia and hypotension, atrioventricular block, and arrhythmias. Respiratory symptoms include initial tachypnea, then bradypnea and pulmonary edema. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Skin symptoms include flushing, cherry-red color. Cyanosis may occur late. Renal and hepatic failure may also occur. Laboratory evaluation reveals severe metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, elevated lactate level, and elevated blood cyanide level. Levels of more than 3.0 mg/L are fatal. Treatment must be initiated quickly, and includes removal of the cyanide source (such as from the skin) and activated charcoal. The Taylor Cyanide Antidote Package may be used. This includes amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. Hydroxocobalamin is also used to directly bind and neutralize cyanide and is often combined with sodium thiosulfate.

It binds to the iron moiety of heme in hemoglobin with much higher affinity than does oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which results in impaired oxygen transport and utilization. It competes with oxygen in binding hemoglobin. This binding leads to a structural change, which limits the ability of the other three oxygen binding sites to release oxygen to peripheral tissues and hence the cherry-red flushed coloration. It can also lead to CNS lipid peroxidation and delayed neurologic sequelae. Some sources include poorly functioning heating systems and improperly vented fuel-burning devices such as kerosene heaters, charcoal grills, camping stoves, gasoline-powered generators, and motor vehicles. Symptoms most commonly include headache, nausea, malaise, dizziness, and cherry-red skin coloration. Severe toxicity can cause seizures, encephalopathy, coma, and cardiovascular instability. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels (which may be normally elevated to an extent in smokers). Treatment should include high-flow 100% oxygen via a nonrebreather mask. In severe cases, histopathology in chronic stages reveals necrosis in the globus pallidus and confluent areas of necrosis in subcortical white matter. Ernst A, Zibrak JD. Carbon monoxide poisoning.

      "explicacao": "This boy most likely has lead intoxication, especially given the timing of symptoms in relation to moving into a very old house. Given this scenario, one must be concerned about the possibility of 1417 lead intoxication as lead-based paint in old houses has been a frequent etiology, especially in children. Many other occupational exposures are possible but would be seen more in adults. Lead inhibits the sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes such as γ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase in heme synthesis, which causes disruption of hemoglobin synthesis and leads to the production of free erythrocyte protoporphyrins. Lead also competes with calcium in several biologic systems and processes, such as mitochondrial respiration and nerve functions, and has been implicated as contributing mechanisms in neurotoxicity. Common symptoms of lead toxicity include abdominal pain (lead colic), constipation, myalgias, arthralgias, seizures, psychomotor slowing, headache, and anorexia. Basophilic stippling of red blood cells and microcytic hypochromic anemia are often seen. In addition, a bluish pigmentation at the gum-tooth line is sometimes seen. A peripheral neuropathy classically with extensor weakness or “wrist/ankle drop” is associated with lead toxicity and is due to an axonal degeneration that primarily affects motor nerves. Generally, removal from the lead source is the only treatment needed, although chelation therapy with 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer), and calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate are also available.

      "explicacao": "This patient likely has organophosphate/carbamate poisoning related to the use of insecticide/pesticide. The only listed item that is not recommended in this clinical situation is gastric lavage because of a substantial risk of aspiration, given the increased secretions and decreased mental status in many patients. Organophosphates and carbamates are potent cholinesterase inhibitors leading to severe cholinergic toxicity. Toxicity can result from ingestion, cutaneous exposure, or inhalation. Some organophosphates are also used as terrorist nerve agents and include tabun, sarin, and soman. Two common mnemonics used to remember the cholinergic/muscarinic crisis signs are as follows: SLUDGE: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric Emesis. DUMBELS: Defecation, Urination, Miosis, Bronchorrhea/Bronchospasm/Bradycardia, Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation. 1420 Often these patients will develop the “intermediate syndrome,” approximately 12 to 96 hours after exposure that consists of weakness, fasciculations, tachycardia, hypertension, decreased deep tendon reflexes, cranial nerve abnormalities, proximal muscle weakness, and respiratory insufficiency. In addition, some organophosphates can cause organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy, occurring 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Symptoms include painful but transient “stocking-glove” paresthesias followed by a symmetrical motor polyneuropathy with flaccid weakness of the lower extremities, which ascends to the upper extremities. Neurobehavioral symptoms may also occur as chronic sequelae. Atropine competes with acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors to help prevent cholinergic activation. Since atropine does not bind to nicotinic receptors, it is ineffective in treating neuromuscular dysfunction, so the cholinesterase-reactivating agent pralidoxime is typically given concurrently with atropine and is effective in treating manifestations resulting from activation of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Benzodiazepines are used for organophosphate-related seizures and sometimes for seizure prophylaxis. Activated charcoal is recommended if presentation is within 1 hour of ingestion. Gastric lavage is not recommended as mentioned earlier. Eddleston M, Roberts D, Buckley N. Management of severe organophosphorus pesticide poisoning. Crit Care. 2002;6(3):259 . Moretto A, Lotti M.

      "explicacao": "1421 This patient describes symptoms most consistent with botulism, likely related to foodborne source from home canning. Botulism is a potentially life-threatening neuroparalytic syndrome resulting from exposure to botulinum toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum. There are at least eight distinct types of botulinum toxin, although the most commonly involved is botulinum toxin A. There are multiple forms of botulism including foodborne botulism (ingestion of food contaminated by botulinum toxin), wound botulism (infection of a wound by C. botulinum, with subsequent production of neurotoxin), infantile botulism (ingestion of clostridial spores that then colonize the gastrointestinal tract and release toxin), adult enteric infectious botulism (toxin produced in the gastrointestinal tract), and inhalational botulism (aerosolized toxin related to acts of bioterrorism). Botulinum toxin binds to the synaptotagmin II receptor on presynaptic cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions. After the heavy chain of the toxin binds to the receptors, the light chain translocates into the nerve cell via endocytosis. Upon entering the cytoplasm, the toxin irreversibly inhibits acetylcholine release by cleaving various proteins involved in neuroexocytosis of acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin A and E cleave SNAP-25; botulinum toxin C cleaves SNAP-25 and syntaxin; and botulinum B, D, F, and G cleave synaptobrevin. Reversal of this inhibition requires sprouting of a new presynaptic terminal and formation of a new synapse. This generally takes 3 to 6 months. Although the toxin can be quite harmful, these effects are used for therapeutic purposes, such as for the treatment of dystonia, spasticity, and other neurologic disorders. Symptoms related to foodborne botulism may begin within 12 to 36 hours after ingestion of the toxin but may be delayed for several days. Symptoms include acute onset of multiple cranial neuropathies, blurred vision (due to fixed pupillary dilation), symmetric descending weakness, urinary retention, and constipation. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting often precede neurologic symptoms in foodborne botulism. Symptoms in this case are not consistent with myasthenia gravis (there is no diurnal variation or other historical points to suggest 1422 fatigability; discussed in Chapter 10 ), Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (discussed in Chapter 10 ), or Guillain–Barré syndrome (which presents with ascending, not descending, weakness and without pupillary involvement; discussed in Chapter 9 ). He has no history of cancer and is otherwise healthy, making leptomeningeal carcinomatosis unlikely, especially with the abrupt onset of symptoms. Hughes JM, Blumenthal JR, Merson MH, et al.
